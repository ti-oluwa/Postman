You are saying that you Arjun

00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,176
- Arjun is fighting agents of death - not the corpse did not find it

684
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,520
You are all kept in the dark of him

685

Implying that he is pretending dead yet

686
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,523
Well, this was too outrageous

687
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,188
If he really is disguised as dead if

688
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,856
He had no reason to expose their story ah

689
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,023
So his identity will be exposed ah

690
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,192
Of course, the reason

691
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,033

But this how the ...

696
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,201
The special agent, like Arjuna, like a kite shield plan

697
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,874

Taking advantage of this time to kite shield plan exposed to comics

700
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,377
The timing is too coincidental not

701
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:09,383
You are saying that our agents have been killed this cartoon associated with it

702
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,385

704
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,898

706
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,901
He also had a relationship with a good guy now

707
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,064
After the planned obsolescence

708
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,905
Aci agents placed in the other team

709
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,409
He was the last to leave the kite shield

710
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,074
It is very beneficial to grab that guy

711
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,739
