2
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,156
There's bad energy here.

3
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,031
I can feel it.

4
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:51,706
Chiku, feelings are injurious
to health.

5
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,656
What happened to you?

6
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:10,318
They are here.

7
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,635
Baba!

8
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,302
Baba.

9
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:36,760
Please save my daughter, Guddi.

10
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,635
I'll feast on the tantric's blood!

11
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,052
You're all going to die!

12
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:47,635
She speaks in a man's voice.

13
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,052
She's possessed by her grandfather.

14
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,718
Ever since he died,

15
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,927
Guddi's been acting weird.

16
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,302
Don't worry.

17
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:58,760
We'll solve your problem.

18
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:05,927
Hello.

19
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,802
Hello.

20
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:43,010
Seems like a powerful spirit.

21
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:00,593
Where did she go?

22
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:02,510
Don't know.

23
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:08,885
Welcome, you cursed souls!

24
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:13,760
If you wish to live, run away!

25
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,635
Respects, Grandpa.

26
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,677
I am Vibhooti Vaidya.

27
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:23,927
And this is my brother,
Chiraunji Vaidya.

28
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,468
Exorcism specialist,

29
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,543
four-time gold medallist.

30
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:31,758
Respected Grandpa,

31
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,885
what is it you desire?

32
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,927
Why are you scaring your family?

33
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:40,302
Connect with me.

34
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:41,593
Connect with me.

35
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:57,635
Sprinkle holy water.

36
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,218
Get rid of Grandpa.

37
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,802
Begone, spirit. Begone, spirit.

38
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,593
Begone, spirit!

39
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,927
Brother!

40
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,510
Let me go! Let me go!

41
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:22,427
Let me go, or I'll curse you
for good. Leave me.

42
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,885
-You can try. Don't feel shy.
-Grandpa!

43
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,593
Heel to my command, evil spirit,

44
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:28,760
or I will send you to hell.

45
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:31,718
-What if I possess you?
-Let's talk, Grandpa.

46
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:33,748
Ghosts are my friends, Grandpa.

47
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:36,635
Friends with benefits.

48
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:39,843
Leave me. Brother!

49
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:43,302
Don't touch me. I am celibate!
Get her off me, brother!

50
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:45,968
Don't worry. She is possessed
by Grandpa after all.

51
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:47,543
You can touch her.

52
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:50,510
-Stop calling your brother.
-Do you hear what you're saying?

53
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:52,968
Help me!

54
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:55,427
You shave every day, don't you?

55
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,302
Brother...

56
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:59,385
I want your blood.

57
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,593
Don't be crazy, Grandpa.

58
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,096
-I'll fry your insides.
-Grandpa...

59
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:10,843
Brother.

60
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,635
What are you doing, Grandpa?

61
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,343
-Get her off me.
-Handsome tantric.

62
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:20,552
Grandpa, no means no!

63
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:23,552
Listen here,
little miss drama queen.

64
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:30,052
You can act, indeed.

65
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,635
Can I have some water?

66
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:46,343
My family wants to marry me off,
but I want to continue studying.

67
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,177
She's so clever.

68
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:50,760
You should take lessons from her.

69
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,218
And your eyes?

70
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,593
Lensmart.

71
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,385
And those footsteps up there?

72
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:07,510
She should be on our team.

73
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:09,843
Are you going to expose my scam?

74
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:13,302
We believe in new beginnings.

75
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:19,177
We help you,
and you help we, sister.

76
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,468
Now listen carefully.

77
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:25,843
Do you like Coke?

78
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:32,593
Jagranam. Bhaskaram.
Arogyam Setuyam.

79
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:36,427
Nightriderum, Sunrisurum

80
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,218
Elevenum...

81
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,885
Go ahead, baba.

82
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:57,468
Grandpa's wish is that Guddi should
marry only after completing her PhD.

83
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,343
But, baba, her marriage--

84
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,052
If you refuse, you'll prepare
for her funeral.

85
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,677
Educate girls to save girls.

86
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,635
What are you waiting for?
Say we agree.

87
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,218
We accept, Grandpa. We accept.

88
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,302
We accept.

89
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:18,968
Accepted.

90
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:22,186
Grandpa, your wishes
will be fulfilled.

91
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:25,552
Go, Grandpa,
to your final resting place.

92
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:33,850
Brother...

93
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:41,635
Grandpa's spirit juice.

94
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,343
No...

95
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,147
You got what you wanted.
Now get up!

96
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:58,772
Where am I?

97
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:04,397
Mom, Dad, what was happening to me?

98
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:06,772
My child!

99
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:09,439
-My dear.
-Who are these people?

100
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:19,605
Uncle, what about GST?

101
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:31,189
As long as there is superstition,
our business will thrive.

102
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:34,855
And so will our sins.

103
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,064
Forgive us, Father,
for we have cheated again.

104
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,113
What do you mean?

105
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:15,022
If we are cheats,
what was the girl, a saint?

106
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:17,064
Didn't we solve her problem too?

107
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,522
But what about the other scams
we keep doing?

108
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,855
It's a very long list.

109
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,980
Chiku, don't insult my talents,
or I will curse you.

110
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:28,189
The food's making your brain fat.

111
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,064
What you call cheating,
I call making a living.

112
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:35,147
Even thieves make a living.

113
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:36,897
We're tantrics.

114
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:39,022
We're supposed to protect people.

115
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:42,772
We possess Father's blessings
and his holy book.

116
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:45,689
They are just embroidery designs.

117
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:48,022
You've been glued to it
ever since you were a kid.

118
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,772
Let see you read something from it.

119
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:53,897
It's a 5,000-year-old language.

120
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:56,480
One needs strict discipline
to decipher it.

121
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:58,939
And someday I will.

122
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:01,397
Like hell you will.

123
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:03,980
You won't stumble upon
some magical dictionary.

124
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,439
I have hit middle age
trying to explain to you

125
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,355
that this is just business.

126
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,980
There are no ghosts
or spirits in reality.

127
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,855
It's all superstition, my brother.

128
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:15,439
Believing without seeing
is superstition.

129
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,105
But rejecting what you can't see
is even worse. Don't forget.

130
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:23,814
Fool.

131
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,814
You can be right
dozens of times, brother.

132
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,564
But I have to prove myself right
only once.

133
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:31,772
All I need is one real case.

134
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,480
You're so naive, Chiku.

135
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:38,355
This is why I love you so much.

136
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:04,772
Your son's spirit is
telling us his last wish.

137
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:06,772
He wants to be married!

138
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,064
Congratulations.

139
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:31,689
The marriage was a success.

140
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:33,772
The spirit has attained salvation.

141
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,314
Immerse it immediately.

142
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:32,814
Welcome to
the Spirit Carnival 2021.

143
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:35,564
Whether ghosts, ghouls or destiny,

144
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:38,772
you'll find a solution
to every problem here.

145
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:45,064
Come one, come all, tell us your
problems and let us find a solution.

146
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:11,971
God bless. God bless.

147
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:15,202
God bless. God bless.

148
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:18,709
God bless. God bless.

149
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,562
Hail Mahakankal,
exorcise the spirit!

150
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:26,788
Go! Go! Go!

151
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:31,147
Goggle Baba, Space Baba, Bengali Baba,
Yoda Baba, tantric and Nath Panthi.

152
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:32,605
What service are you looking for?

153
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,105
Which baba do you want to meet?

154
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:35,185
Ullat Baba.

155
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:38,439
Ullat Baba? Very best choice.

156
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:51,980
Old Baba, I'll teach your sons
every lesson from A to Z.

157
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:56,855
Eyes open, chakra close.

158
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:01,605
Eyes close, chakra open.

159
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:05,808
You feel energy? Feel...

160
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:08,795
More feel.

161
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:14,427
Breathe energy. The energy of love.

162
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,709
Yes. Chakra is full open.

163
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:34,753
My dear Vibhooti and Chiraunji.

164
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:39,183
The world is an illusion,
and this book is your answer.

165
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,999
If you practice these spells
with dedication and hard work,

166
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,208
this book shall guide you.

167
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,387
Be fearless.

168
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:49,179
Be worthy of this power,
and tread with faith.

169
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:51,902
I shall always be by your side.

170
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,679
Where are you, Father?

171
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:58,804
Give me a sign.

172
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:08,345
My book!

173
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,929
God bless. God bless.

174
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,887
God bless. God bless.

175
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,514
My book!

176
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,929
My book. My book.

177
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,209
Is it yours?

178
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:26,679
Is it yours?

179
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,012
Yes, thank you.

180
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,304
Here you go.

181
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:30,970
Come, madam.

182
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:44,095
The key.

183
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:48,762
I found the key!

184
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:51,512
I found the dictionary!

185
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,595
Ullat Baba
was my dear departed father.

186
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:56,929
I am his son Goggle Baba.

187
00:17:57,095 --> 00:18:00,429
Tell me, child,
what brings you here?

188
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,220
What is the difficulty?

189
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,845
-Goggle Baba--
-Stop. Got it!

190
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:08,488
-Bow to him.
-Got it!

191
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:14,720
Guruji, come with me.

192
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,304
You can make America great again.

193
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,804
No, Suzy, my country is needing me.

194
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:26,429
Found it! Found it!
Brother, I found the key.

195
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:29,137
Now I can decipher any spell.
Which spell do I read first?

196
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,470
Is there a spell here
on how to disappear?

197
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:34,345
Read it and disappear.

198
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:40,429
Fine.

199
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,054
I am leaving.

200
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,304
And presto, begone!

201
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:47,429
For good!

202
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:49,137
For good?

203
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,429
Chiku, wait!

204
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:56,958
Hey...

205
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,179
Move, you drunkard.

206
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,512
Why are you always hanging
outside our tent?

207
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,970
Wait...
Look, you're twitching again.

208
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:08,637
It's not a twitch.
There's bad energy around.

209
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,512
There is no energy around!

210
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,512
This is your frustration.

211
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:15,054
It's time to break
your vow of celibacy.

212
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:17,762
You don't deserve
our father's knowledge.

213
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:20,470
I have been following
our father's teachings.

214
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:21,845
How to scam people.

215
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,887
You have lost your mind.
Out of my way.

216
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:26,137
Chiku, wait.

217
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:31,179
Fine, leave
your helpless brother alone.

218
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,595
Forget all the things
I ever did for you. Forget them.

219
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:39,470
I was only this young

220
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,512
when you arrived.

221
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,804
Our mother died
as soon as you arrived!

222
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:45,887
Then Father left us
a few years later.

223
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:49,970
I spent days starving
so you could eat.

224
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:53,929
Survived on bananas
so you can have bread!

225
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,682
Last time, it was peanuts.

226
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,595
Focus on the emotions, will you?

227
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:04,554
I have no one in this world.

228
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:07,387
No one to support me in my old age.

229
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:08,637
Get lost!

230
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:11,724
Poor, helpless me--

231
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,929
Fine, I'm not going.
I changed my plans.

232
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:15,804
No wife or son...

233
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:17,724
I changed my plans.
I am not going. Now get up.

234
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:21,095
Poor restless spirit... Poor--

235
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,345
Nincompoop.

236
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:24,512
I am not leaving. Now get up.

237
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:27,741
Chiku! Chiku.

238
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,012
I'll do anything you want,
just name it.

239
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:33,387
Honestly?

240
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:35,304
Will you turn over a new leaf?

241
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:38,345
We'll strive to be real tantrics,
just like our father.

242
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:42,877
Jai Hind, sir.

243
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,179
-Go!
-Go? You just said don't go.

244
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,711
Hey!

245
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,406
What's the matter, brother?

246
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,137
Why are we hiding? What's wrong?

247
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:55,220
Inspector Chedilal.

248
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,220
He's followed us all the way here.

249
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:59,220
What do you expect
when you cheat people?

250
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,095
I am not the only one
cheating people.

251
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,887
Pack our things
and meet me at the van.

252
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,012
I'll take him for a spin.

253
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:11,512
Hey, Chedi, how are you?

254
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:20,580
Sorry, don't mind.

255
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:24,494
Stop, you charlatan!

256
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:27,430
Hey, mister!

257
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:31,804
Stop.

258
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:56,804
I only travel in AC taxis, child.

259
00:21:57,554 --> 00:21:58,720
I see.

260
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:01,724
Wait a minute. There's your van.

261
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:03,304
I have no vehicle.

262
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:06,845
I'm the baba who sold his Maruti
long year back.

263
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,304
But it says here
"Ullat Baba and Sons."

264
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:12,012
My father was a great tantric.

265
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,304
People use his name
to run their shady businesses.

266
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,137
Bloody frauds!
May they die and turn into ghosts.

267
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,387
Goggle, you fraud.

268
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,099
Goggle.

269
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:24,097
Wait!

270
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:25,179
How dare you cheat people?

271
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,220
What rude behaviour is this?

272
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,220
We are the original
Ullat Baba and Sons, madam.

273
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:29,640
He's a fraud.

274
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,724
If I get enraged,
and I open my third eye,

275
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:35,220
then it will cause
great destruction.

276
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:36,379
Really?

277
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:41,220
This was the only
customised goggles I had.

278
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,345
Now you broke it.
How will I do business now?

279
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:48,137
If you try to misuse
my father's name again,

280
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
I'll gouge your remaining eyes out.
Remember that!

281
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:55,179
You two sons are the real
embarrassment to your father.

282
00:22:55,637 --> 00:22:57,304
Bunch of useless frauds.

283
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:59,179
-They are responsible for Baba's death--
-Shut up!

284
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:01,474
What did you say?

285
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,724
-Wait a minute. Listen to me.
-What?

286
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:06,487
Boys, attack!

287
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:18,137
The Tantric Association
will hear about this!

288
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,304
Here comes another one.

289
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,595
No, he's my brother, Vibhooti.

290
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,637
Chiku, get in the van!

291
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,429
She's come looking for our father.
It seems like a real case.

292
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:39,970
Very good. Very good.

293
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,470
Get her in too.

294
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:42,887
Yes, please. Come on.

295
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:47,804
Don't doubt us.

296
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:49,970
You touched my father's book
with your lucky hands.

297
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,512
There must be
some kind of connection.

298
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:53,637
Have faith.

299
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,554
Chiku, Chedi's right behind us!

300
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:09,637
What the...

301
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,929
Sir, I know where they are headed.
They're going to Dharamshala.

302
00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:17,720
Are they wanted for murder?

303
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:18,763
Worse.

304
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:23,843
I forgot to introduce myself.

305
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:26,974
Myself Chiraunji,
and that's my brother, Vibhooti.

306
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:28,345
How to do, madam?

307
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,220
So, why were you looking
for my father?

308
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,345
What's the case?

309
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,304
27 years ago, your father came
to our estate and solved our problem.

310
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:37,220
My father brought him there.

311
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:39,095
And I'm taking you two there now.

312
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,470
Honestly, I don't know
where to begin.

313
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:44,012
It may sound a little strange.

314
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:45,970
Nothing is strange for us, madam.

315
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:48,054
Please begin.

316
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:52,095
We own tea estates
near Dharamshala...

317
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:57,637
Near Dharamshala...

318
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,179
Brother!

319
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:06,179
We own tea estates near Dharamshala.
Silawar Estate.

320
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:09,970
We produced the best tea
in the country.

321
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:12,554
My dad was really proud of it.

322
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,137
But everything changed
after his death.

323
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:17,804
My sister returned from London,

324
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:19,554
and together we began
managing the estate.

325
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:22,470
Our factory has been incurring losses
for a long time.

326
00:25:23,512 --> 00:25:24,887
You own a factory.

327
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,220
Please continue.

328
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:29,762
The tea estates are useless
without the workers.

329
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:35,095
And, for the past two weeks,
my workers have been afraid.

330
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,762
Vinod.

331
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:45,512
What's happening?
Why is everyone leaving?

332
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:49,762
Everyone wants to be home
before nightfall, ma'am.

333
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,804
There is no ghost here.
You make them understand.

334
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:57,470
If it's about the salary,
I promise it won't be late this time.

335
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:58,637
Please.

336
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:04,304
What good is money
without life, ma'am?

337
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:07,720
-Vinod--
-See you tomorrow.

338
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,095
Who's there?

339
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:57,762
Who's there?

340
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:42,220
I barely managed to get home.

341
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,762
But it was definitely
something supernatural.

342
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:47,637
There's a Kichkandi in my estate.

343
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:51,179
Kich what?

344
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,929
-Kichkandi.
-Yes.

345
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:55,845
Kichkandi...

346
00:27:56,804 --> 00:27:58,095
Take over the wheels, brother.

347
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,929
I think Father mentioned something
about it in his book, Ms. Maya.

348
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,220
Kichkandi!

349
00:28:03,637 --> 00:28:06,345
Your father was the one
who drove her away 27 years ago.

350
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,345
I don't know how she returned.

351
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:10,054
She dwells in the mountains.

352
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,220
A stubborn and dangerous spirit.

353
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,179
Ferocious.

354
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:16,054
Don't worry, madam.

355
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,595
We know these spirits well.

356
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:21,323
They are real drama queens.

357
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,845
Hungry for attention.

358
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,095
We'll have to perform
the Naked Spirit ritual.

359
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:29,512
Yes, that's the best option.

360
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:31,179
We'll all have to strip.

361
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:32,911
Full nude.

362
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,137
Sorry, I misread it.
It's Blood Spirit ritual.

363
00:28:35,554 --> 00:28:37,554
We'll have to perform
the Blood Spirit ritual.

364
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,137
To destroy the Kichkandi!

365
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,762
Look how passionate he is.

366
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,804
Don't worry. We'll get
rid of this Kachkundi for you.

367
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,804
Advance is Rs. 51,000.

368
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:50,345
Food, travel, lodging at your cost.

369
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,637
No, no.

370
00:28:52,304 --> 00:28:54,304
We will not charge any fee, madam.

371
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,970
This is our father's case
from long ago.

372
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:57,970
We assure you good
after-sales service for free.

373
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:01,970
-Sorry.
-There was a cat on the road.

374
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:41,637
Ma'am is back!

375
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:43,762
Come on.

376
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
Hello, ma'am.

377
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,304
Hello, hello.
What were you doing?

378
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:49,387
-Playing.
-Playing.

379
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:51,012
These are our worker's children.

380
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:52,724
Their village is just up ahead,

381
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:54,970
-and our estate is beyond that.
-Very good.

382
00:29:56,053 --> 00:29:58,470
-What were you playing?
-Hide-and-seek.

383
00:29:58,804 --> 00:30:00,012
Really?

384
00:30:00,304 --> 00:30:02,929
It's quite late.
Don't play out here at night.

385
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:05,037
There are wild animals here.

386
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,679
-Come on, go home. Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

387
00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:39,804
Shonku, Shonku, Shonku.

388
00:30:41,387 --> 00:30:42,724
Shonku. Good boy.

389
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:44,637
You're such a good boy.

390
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,054
My grandfather bought
this place in 1942.

391
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:53,095
Our family's been running
tea estates out here ever since.

392
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,970
You'll be staying
at the guest house.

393
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,762
I'll get the keys.

394
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,179
Bravo, bro!

395
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,845
This is actually a real case.

396
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:05,804
This is a five-star hotel.

397
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,970
We're not here on vacation.
We're here to work.

398
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:10,762
Yes, that is important.

399
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,429
Work hard.

400
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:16,887
I'll soak up the sun
on the swing here,

401
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:18,804
work out on this lawn,

402
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:21,012
and have breakfast
over there.

403
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,054
And we'll get fired by lunchtime.

404
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,387
Here you go.

405
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,429
Where did you find
these two ulti babas?

406
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:03,929
"Ullat Baba."

407
00:32:04,012 --> 00:32:05,179
Yeah, same thing.

408
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:08,137
Kanu, please.
Let's not do this again.

409
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,470
That's Kanika, my sister.

410
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,762
And these are Ullat Baba's sons,
Vibhooti and Chiraunji.

411
00:32:15,762 --> 00:32:17,345
They are here to help us.

412
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,387
Help us? Or themselves?

413
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,724
Kanu, please.

414
00:32:21,804 --> 00:32:23,345
Your sister is quite rude, madam.

415
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:24,724
I am sorry. Actually, she--

416
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,470
You will pay
for this disrespectful behaviour.

417
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,595
Rs. 21,000 in cash.

418
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:31,304
Or we leave.

419
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:32,724
Good riddance!

420
00:32:32,804 --> 00:32:34,429
Fine, I accept.

421
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:36,762
Then we stay.

422
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:38,429
My God.

423
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,137
How can we pay?

424
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:44,304
Hasn't my sister told you
we're bankrupt?

425
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:48,595
Penniless, poor, no money.

426
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,512
We're not here
to earn money, madam.

427
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:52,724
Fine! Then you are
basically free of cost.

428
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,470
Not even death
is free of cost, madam.

429
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:58,845
You are much pettier
than your house might suggest.

430
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:03,595
Do not presume to know everything.

431
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,012
But that is what I am here for.

432
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:08,304
I can see all that is hidden.

433
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:11,387
And when you realize
just how much I can see,

434
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:13,512
it will blow your mind.

435
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:19,804
Madame, detox day today.

436
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:21,762
Give me that, Hari.

437
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:24,887
Greetings, baba!
Thousand greetings to you!

438
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,012
God bless. God bless.

439
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:29,304
Myself Hari Kumar.
General manager of Silawar Estate.

440
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:30,970
You may not believe this,

441
00:33:31,054 --> 00:33:33,220
but I've heard stories
about you since I was a kid.

442
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,595
Thanks to yoga you seem
to not have aged at all.

443
00:33:39,095 --> 00:33:40,595
Madame, I must say

444
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:42,470
Ullat Baba is too ageless.

445
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:46,054
Mister, you're mistaking
the son for the father.

446
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:47,762
Ullat Baba and Sons.

447
00:33:49,304 --> 00:33:50,804
-I apologise, baba.
-It's all right.

448
00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:54,179
Madam, the villagers have been waiting
since morning to meet Ullat Baba.

449
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:55,699
Lazy lumps will grab any excuse
to shirk work.

450
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,375
-Tell them to push off.
-Okay, madam.

451
00:33:57,459 --> 00:33:58,750
-Wait, Hari.
-Yes, madam.

452
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,500
-Come with me, you two.
-Yes.

453
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,875
Please, this way.

454
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:06,834
Hari, where are you going?

455
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,209
Baba will give a speech.

456
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:11,042
Feed milk to Shonku. Go.

457
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,084
Okay, madame.

458
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:20,397
They are here.

459
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:23,166
Baba is smart and good-looking.

460
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:26,542
-Hello, madam.
-Hello. Hello.

461
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:31,500
I promised I will
only return with baba.

462
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,295
-Here they are.
-Hello.

463
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:36,959
No need to be scared.
They will help us.

464
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,459
People of Silawar,
your days of despair are over.

465
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:45,792
Your guardians Ullat Baba and sons
have arrived.

466
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:52,292
There are no spirits
we haven't exorcised.

467
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,084
Let me introduce you
to Chiraunji baba.

468
00:34:56,459 --> 00:35:00,167
Exorcism specialist,
four... five-time gold medallist.

469
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,542
Baba has won an award.

470
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,584
Five times.

471
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:05,792
Settle down. Settle down.

472
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:12,167
Now it's our responsibility to rid
this village of the Kichkandi.

473
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:17,334
And our real gold medal
will be to complete this job.

474
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,232
Friends,

475
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:27,545
we've dealt with
more powerful spirits in our life.

476
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,500
And this is an ordinary Kichkandi.

477
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,584
Kichkandi!

478
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,042
Kichkandi! Kichkandi!

479
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,167
Oh, no.

480
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,919
Show yourself if you dare!

481
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,917
Stop overdoing it, brother.

482
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,750
Let's see you enter her house!

483
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:47,875
Or kill him!

484
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:51,429
Or possess her!

485
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:59,292
This is Vibhooti,
and this is an open challenge.

486
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,375
My brother means to say
that we're completely prepared.

487
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,709
And we'll control this spirit.

488
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,167
You can all go home and rest.

489
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,292
-Let's go.
-Yes, go home, but...

490
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,459
hold each other's hand.

491
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,542
Soon it will be nightfall.

492
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:32,381
-Hurry up.
-I'm hurrying up.

493
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:37,116
Come on, run.

494
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,542
Wait inside.
I'll be back in a flash.

495
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:18,334
How often have I told you
to eat a light dinner.

496
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,959
Can't you wait until morning?

497
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:21,959
It's not my fault.

498
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:24,625
Why did you cook
such delicious mutton?

499
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:26,754
Wait inside.
I'll be back in a flash.

500
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,709
Are you going
to leave me alone here?

501
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,795
What if she possesses me?

502
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,000
Then say a little prayer,
and let's go.

503
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,459
Hurry up.

504
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,362
Watch where you're going.

505
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:52,584
Look where you're going.

506
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:08,834
Keep walking.

507
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:20,616
Here.

508
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,045
Wait outside.

509
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,125
-Or will you come inside?
-No, I'm fine.

510
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:28,939
-Hurry up.
-Yes.

511
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,900
-Don't take too long.
-No.

512
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:35,750
Listen...

513
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:38,334
How's the pressure?

514
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:53,459
-Lata sweetheart.
-Yes.

515
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,055
Sing something.

516
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,250
This is very scary for me.

517
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,334
Don't be stupid.

518
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,750
What if she hears us?

519
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,334
Please, sweetheart.

520
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,709
It's so scary
that I am constipated.

521
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,834
This is no time to request a song.

522
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,167
Please, sweetheart, sing a song.

523
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,500
Okay, fine.
You've got a death wish today.

524
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,250
-Hurry up.
-Fine, I am singing.

525
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,375
Now.

526
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:25,917
Everyone's singing
Everyone's elated

527
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:29,250
Why are we so quiet?

528
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:35,250
Strike a chord in my heart

529
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:40,084
Why are we so silent?
Sing with me

530
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:42,460
Come to me

531
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
Is it coming?

532
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,584
It's coming.
It's coming. Keep singing.

533
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,042
Come to me

534
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,000
Lata dear, why did you stop?

535
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:10,875
Lata sweetie?

536
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:13,834
My dear?

537
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:16,750
Darling, my dear?

538
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Lata...

539
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,834
Why aren't you singing?

540
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,250
Kichkandi!

541
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,375
Forgive us.

542
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,667
Forgive us, Kichkandi.

543
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:39,834
Forgive us.

544
00:40:39,914 --> 00:40:41,209
Forgive us.

545
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:43,505
Forgive us.

546
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:50,417
Forgive us. Forgive us.

547
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,209
Forgive us.

548
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,792
I stand in solidarity
with my people.

549
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:15,917
When will superstitions end
in my country?

550
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,834
Wake up. Get back to your jobs.
Earn some money.

551
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:24,042
Let's break the shackles
of superstition! Go on!

552
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,334
#goosebumps, madame.

553
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:34,792
Welcome, disaster babas.

554
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,578
Speak your minds.
I am with you.

555
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:39,584
It's horrible, baba.

556
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,170
You've made Kichkandi furious.

557
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,292
-Yes...
-She will kill us all.

558
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,709
Who saw Kichkandi?

559
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:52,042
It was you. You challenged her.

560
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,125
Now she's here.

561
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,084
Look at his condition.

562
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,167
He's turned completely pale.

563
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:02,795
Stay back. We won't be impressed
by your sweet talks anymore.

564
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,667
-You go, Lata!
-Go.

565
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:07,375
Calm down. Calm down, please.

566
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:08,375
Yes.

567
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,375
Give baba a chance to speak.

568
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:17,209
O naive villagers, who would
know a spirit better than a tantric?

569
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:21,917
And who would know how to
take advantage of your innocence?

570
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,709
Enough, please.

571
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,417
These babas are here to help us.

572
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,875
But, madam, Ullat Baba
solved our problem immediately.

573
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:31,375
These people seem hopeless.

574
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:33,959
Nepotism has ruined this country.

575
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:39,125
I think they are
not sons of Ullat Baba.

576
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:41,709
-Right, right...
-Who said that?

577
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,375
Who said that?

578
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:45,584
We're the original Vaidyas.

579
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:50,375
The seventh generation
of the Kaal Bhairav tantric clan.

580
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:55,000
We've documents
of all our ancestors.

581
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,417
Who wants to see them?

582
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:01,375
Do you want to see them?

583
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,375
Lata, what's that one thing
you're an expert in?

584
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,292
The thing no one can do
better than you.

585
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:09,792
What's special about you?

586
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,584
Mutton sekuwa.

587
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:13,792
No one can make it better than me.
Isn't that right?

588
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,834
Did I ask whether you add
oil first or water?

589
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
No, you didn't.

590
00:43:19,584 --> 00:43:24,375
Then you've no right
to ask how we do our job.

591
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,709
Let us do our job our way.

592
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:31,834
Please.

593
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,792
Let the leaves grow in the estate.

594
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,667
Not in your minds.

595
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,667
We challenged the Kichkandi
and she came.

596
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:48,375
You shouldn't be mourning,
but you should be happy.

597
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:54,917
If we can summon her,
can't we drive her away?

598
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:56,959
Repeat after me.

599
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:59,475
-Go, Kichkandi!
-Go, Kichkandi!

600
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:02,125
-Go, Kichkandi!
-Go, Kichkandi!

601
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:04,662
-Go, Kichkandi!
-Go, Kichkandi!

602
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,459
-Go, Kichkandi!
-Kichkandi, go!

603
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:09,976
-Kichkandi, go!
-Kichkandi, go!

604
00:44:10,056 --> 00:44:12,417
-Go, Kichkandi!
-Go, Kichkandi!

605
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,337
-Go, Kichkandi!
-Go, Kichkandi!

606
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:18,042
-Go, Kichkandi!
-Go, Kichkandi!

607
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:22,625
Bless you.

608
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:24,875
Bless you.

609
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,552
Don't touch me.

610
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:34,375
Dark energy.

611
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:36,905
Bless you.

612
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,709
Bless you.

613
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:42,959
Bless you. Bless you.

614
00:44:43,155 --> 00:44:45,031
Bless you. Bless you.

615
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:59,042
See, everyone's happy
and back to work.

616
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,917
I have a strong feeling everything
will return to normal soon.

617
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,667
What will you pay them for salary?

618
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:05,917
Baba's blessings.

619
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,754
We can turn this around, Kanu.

620
00:45:07,834 --> 00:45:09,712
Provided you drop
this negative approach.

621
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,750
I am being practical, Maya.

622
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:15,292
Let's sell everything
and move to London.

623
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,042
I have a strong base there.

624
00:45:17,265 --> 00:45:20,209
We'll open
an exclusive bar in Soho.

625
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,542
We'll have the best music,
the best cocktails.

626
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:26,292
Really hot bouncers.

627
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:30,792
And Long Island iced tea.

628
00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:35,375
That way you can still follow
your passion for tea.

629
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:36,834
You just don't get it.

630
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,084
This estate is Papa's legacy.

631
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:42,542
Fine. We'll name our bar
after Papa.

632
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:44,875
Kulbhushan Bar?

633
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,667
No, no, no, I take that back.

634
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,378
Sorry, Papa.

635
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,709
You know what?
Focus on your blogging or whatever.

636
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,250
And leave me
and this factory alone.

637
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:56,000
-Thank you so much for your support.
-Mayu...

638
00:45:56,084 --> 00:45:57,917
No, no, thanks for your support.

639
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,959
"No, no, thanks for your support."

640
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,667
"Hard at work."

641
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:09,334
Don't be scared.
Tell baba what you saw.

642
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:12,084
She had silky hair.

643
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,750
Her sari was torn everywhere.

644
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:16,209
Anything else?

645
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:18,292
And she was spewing
lightning from her mouth.

646
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,780
Lighting?

647
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:21,375
From her mouth.

648
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,472
You tell them. Tell them.

649
00:46:30,552 --> 00:46:32,459
She looked scary.

650
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,803
She had long iron nails.

651
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:38,125
She looked like the mummy.

652
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:39,625
Mummy? Whose mummy?

653
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:42,459
Baba, she meant the Egyptian mummy.

654
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,042
-Covered in strips.
-That's what we saw.

655
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,264
-Exactly this one.
-Covered in strips.

656
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:47,709
Have you seen it too?

657
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:56,792
-Have you seen the Kich--
-Baba, where's the time?

658
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:58,542
I'm the general manager
of the estate.

659
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,250
I generally do
all the work around here.

660
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,000
Madame's shopping, her shooting,
factory, Shonku, make-up.

661
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:06,250
Make-up?

662
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,084
Her make-up comes
specially from London.

663
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,417
Look at this pretty little plant.
It's tea.

664
00:47:15,678 --> 00:47:19,553
How much do you spend on one
cup of tea at an overpriced cafe?

665
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,720
A lot?

666
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:23,720
But our own homegrown tea
we completely disregard.

667
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:26,428
#backtoroots.

668
00:47:30,178 --> 00:47:33,178
Sorry, madam, for photobombing you.

669
00:47:33,428 --> 00:47:34,470
Idiot.

670
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:36,012
Here.

671
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:39,970
You don't look like you feel cold.

672
00:47:40,053 --> 00:47:42,637
And you don't look
like a tantric to me.

673
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:44,720
Why are you wasting your time?

674
00:47:44,803 --> 00:47:46,640
Do your job. Get rid of the ghost.

675
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,262
That's what we're doing.
The Kichkandi can possess anyone.

676
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,345
I am protecting you. Z+ security.

677
00:47:53,428 --> 00:47:55,553
I don't believe in ghosts
or spirits.

678
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:57,178
I don't need your security.

679
00:47:58,178 --> 00:47:59,303
Think again.

680
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:02,137
Ghosts fancy single women.

681
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,970
Do you know
what "fancy" means, madam?

682
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,053
I do. Very well.

683
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:13,720
And I also know
how to kick on it too.

684
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:21,012
We're tenacious, madam.

685
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,929
We'll take all your kicks
without complaint.

686
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:27,137
I saw her on the tree.

687
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:29,387
She was singing aloud.

688
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:31,262
-Singing?
-Like...

689
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:35,470
Yes.

690
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,970
Are you not afraid of ghosts?

691
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:08,345
You're a brave girl, sweetie.

692
00:49:10,345 --> 00:49:12,303
Go play with your friends.

693
00:49:16,762 --> 00:49:18,303
Are you deaf-mute?

694
00:49:20,303 --> 00:49:21,512
Vibhooti.

695
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:24,053
My name's Vibhooti.

696
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:26,178
What's your name?

697
00:49:27,095 --> 00:49:28,095
Pine nuts?

698
00:49:28,762 --> 00:49:31,303
Tree? Leaves? Seeds?

699
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,470
Flowers?

700
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,137
Cow dung?

701
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,095
Titli [butterfly].

702
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:43,720
Great.

703
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,845
This was Chiku's favourite game.

704
00:49:47,095 --> 00:49:49,803
Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe
Catch a tiger by the toe

705
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:56,428
If he hollers, let him go
Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe

706
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,928
Hello. Ullat Baba and Sons.

707
00:50:05,012 --> 00:50:07,303
Hello, this is the queen of Kangra.

708
00:50:07,387 --> 00:50:10,553
My husband's been
possessed by a witch.

709
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:13,095
Please help us.
Please, pretty please.

710
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:14,720
Of course, we'll help.

711
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,928
But, currently,
we don't have dates, madam.

712
00:50:17,012 --> 00:50:21,012
Just tell us wherever you are.
Give me your exact address.

713
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:24,720
I'll throw my husband in the back
of our Mercedes and bring him over.

714
00:50:26,678 --> 00:50:27,637
Oh, no.

715
00:50:28,345 --> 00:50:29,470
Excuse me.

716
00:50:29,553 --> 00:50:34,428
Listen, Chedi, these tricks
won't work on a pro like me.

717
00:50:34,512 --> 00:50:36,637
Listen, you charlatan.

718
00:50:37,262 --> 00:50:40,595
The snake can't escape
the eagle for too long.

719
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:43,803
If your father was Ullat,
then I'm a bullet.

720
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,137
I am in Dharamshala.

721
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:48,720
Then go meet the Dalai Lama.
We're busy.

722
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:53,345
So...

723
00:51:02,553 --> 00:51:03,720
What are you doing here?

724
00:51:04,303 --> 00:51:05,428
Hello, Maya.

725
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:09,720
Looking at my father's picture.

726
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:13,637
That's my father.

727
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,053
I miss him.

728
00:51:18,262 --> 00:51:21,928
The last time I saw him
I was only five.

729
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,387
He called me,
made me sit beside him,

730
00:51:28,887 --> 00:51:30,053
and gave me this book.

731
00:51:30,512 --> 00:51:31,720
He said, "Keep it with you.

732
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:35,345
"It will always guide you."

733
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,887
I was so young and naive,

734
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,970
I said, "Is this a torch
that will guide me?"

735
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,720
He smiled just like you
and said, "You got that right."

736
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:49,720
Then?

737
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:53,720
He wasn't there
when I got up in the morning.

738
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:06,137
-Keep it.
-No, Maya, please.

739
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,470
No, please...

740
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:10,678
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

741
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:16,387
Thank you, Maya.

742
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:22,262
Hello.

743
00:52:23,137 --> 00:52:24,428
Wait, I am coming.

744
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,470
Any luck?

745
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:30,470
I talked to the villagers, but
they are all making wild guesses.

746
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:32,595
No one told me anything solid.

747
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,803
Do you know anyone
from when Father was here?

748
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:38,970
Wait a minute.

749
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,387
Santu.

750
00:52:44,387 --> 00:52:45,682
How could I forget?

751
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:48,303
He was there
when your father came here.

752
00:52:48,553 --> 00:52:50,303
He's lives in a monastery up ahead.

753
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:51,970
You must meet him.

754
00:53:02,303 --> 00:53:04,762
Mr. Santu, we're Vibhooti
and Chiraunji.

755
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:06,178
Sons of Ullat Baba.

756
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:09,137
We need your help.

757
00:53:12,303 --> 00:53:17,887
30 years ago, my wife, Manju,
and I came here from Manali to work.

758
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:21,595
The owner had warned us...

759
00:53:23,262 --> 00:53:24,970
that the jungle
on the other side of the estate

760
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:28,387
is haunted by a Kichkandi
for a 100 years.

761
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:30,303
No one goes there.

762
00:53:31,345 --> 00:53:35,678
One day all the women from
the village returned from work,

763
00:53:36,803 --> 00:53:38,887
except for Manju.

764
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,720
Manju.

765
00:53:58,178 --> 00:53:59,178
Manju.

766
00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:16,595
Meaning the Kichkandi
had possessed her.

767
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,095
That night Manju killed two people

768
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,303
and ran towards the jungle.

769
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:25,887
Then Ullat Baba arrived.

770
00:55:04,428 --> 00:55:05,428
Manju.

771
00:55:09,678 --> 00:55:13,637
Baba finally managed to trap
Manju inside a powerful holy circle.

772
00:55:13,803 --> 00:55:15,803
Heed to the tantric's command,
Kichkandi.

773
00:55:16,178 --> 00:55:19,095
Leave Manju's body.

774
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,428
O Kichkandi,
return to your mortal remains.

775
00:55:55,012 --> 00:55:58,428
Finally, Baba managed to exorcise
the Kichkandi from Manju's body

776
00:55:58,678 --> 00:56:00,470
and trap her in a pot.

777
00:56:03,262 --> 00:56:06,845
And Baba said as long as
the Kichkandi stays trapped,

778
00:56:07,303 --> 00:56:08,720
we'll be safe.

779
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:14,137
He saved Silawar,

780
00:56:15,178 --> 00:56:18,303
but he couldn't save my Manju.

781
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,053
Run away.

782
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,220
Save your lives.

783
00:56:26,387 --> 00:56:28,053
She is death incarnate.

784
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,720
You cannot win against her.

785
00:56:32,095 --> 00:56:33,262
We'll definitely try.

786
00:56:35,178 --> 00:56:37,928
We'll get to the root
of the story, uncle.

787
00:56:48,512 --> 00:56:50,428
Are you prepared
to lose everything?

788
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:07,303
Go lift the gate.
I did it the last time.

789
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:10,928
Father had trapped the Kichkandi.

790
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,512
Now his ritual
has been interrupted.

791
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,678
We should go look for that tree.

792
00:57:17,595 --> 00:57:18,970
I'll slap you.

793
00:57:19,512 --> 00:57:21,762
This is no time
to go look for the tree.

794
00:57:21,845 --> 00:57:23,178
Why? Are you scared?

795
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:26,595
Scared my foot!

796
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:28,303
Come on then.

797
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:31,220
Let's get to the root
of this story.

798
00:57:43,512 --> 00:57:45,678
Show us the way, Father.

799
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:47,720
Show us the way, Father.

800
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:51,553
Our father is not Google Maps
to show the way.

801
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,678
You won't see a damn thing
at night.

802
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,303
Let's come back in the morning.

803
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:58,928
Why don't you admit
that you're scared?

804
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:01,178
It's the only wise thing to do.

805
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:03,887
We're tantrics, not Shikari Shambu.

806
00:58:04,553 --> 00:58:08,095
What if we get attacked
by some wild animal...

807
00:58:11,595 --> 00:58:12,595
Vibhooti!

808
00:58:12,845 --> 00:58:14,137
Vibhooti...

809
00:58:15,178 --> 00:58:16,178
Vibhooti.

810
00:58:16,512 --> 00:58:17,637
Are you okay?

811
00:58:51,303 --> 00:58:53,053
-Hear that?
-What?

812
00:58:54,803 --> 00:58:55,803
Hear what?

813
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:57,137
Exactly.

814
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,762
Isn't it weird?

815
00:59:00,428 --> 00:59:02,303
It's so silent out here.

816
00:59:03,845 --> 00:59:04,845
Yes.

817
00:59:11,762 --> 00:59:13,678
This is where our father
performed the ritual.

818
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:17,262
The pot must be in here.

819
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:26,220
Brother.

820
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:28,928
Hold this.

821
00:59:51,178 --> 00:59:52,428
Chiku! What are you doing?

822
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:57,012
Looking for the pot.

823
01:00:01,943 --> 01:00:03,092
Found it.

824
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,762
-Chiku...
-Wait.

825
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:15,387
Found it.

826
01:00:16,137 --> 01:00:17,470
Yes, found it.

827
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,595
But the pot is still intact.

828
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,595
If the Kichkandi is still inside...

829
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:40,428
then who is scaring the people?

830
01:00:42,637 --> 01:00:43,970
Maybe it's her aunt.

831
01:00:44,762 --> 01:00:45,762
Vibhooti.

832
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,512
Hello. Is Ms. Kichu at home?

833
01:00:50,262 --> 01:00:52,012
Don't mock Father's work, okay.

834
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:55,262
-Brother...
-Enough of this "real ghost" drama.

835
01:00:55,345 --> 01:00:57,387
-Give it back.
-Let's find out

836
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,053
whether our father was even real,

837
01:01:00,459 --> 01:01:01,377
or a fake.

838
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,845
Give it back, brother.

839
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:06,470
Stop. I said give it back.

840
01:01:07,762 --> 01:01:08,762
Give it back...

841
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:12,720
-Brother...
-Chiku.

842
01:01:12,928 --> 01:01:14,762
Look at me, Chiku.
I am the Kichkandi.

843
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:17,178
That's enough, brother.
Give it back.

844
01:01:17,428 --> 01:01:18,845
Kichu. Chiku.

845
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:43,553
Chiku, I am getting a feeling.

846
01:01:44,053 --> 01:01:46,262
Even I am getting a feeling,
brother.

847
01:01:49,012 --> 01:01:50,928
Feelings are injurious to health.

848
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:57,053
You're very naive, Chiku.

849
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:01,887
Did you really believe Father
trapped a Kichkandi in this pot?

850
01:02:02,137 --> 01:02:05,845
You fool,
there is no Kichkandi in this pot,

851
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:07,095
or outside.

852
01:02:08,387 --> 01:02:10,303
-But--
-But what, Chiku?

853
01:02:10,595 --> 01:02:12,178
-What about Manju?
-Shut up.

854
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:15,178
Father took advantage
of that crazy woman

855
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,303
and screwed with people's minds.

856
01:02:18,095 --> 01:02:19,053
Why this...

857
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,887
Oh, no!

858
01:02:25,762 --> 01:02:28,803
You made me miss the finale
of Naagin.

859
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:30,387
Now I'll have to watch the repeat.

860
01:02:33,762 --> 01:02:35,095
Much ado about nothing.

861
01:03:07,723 --> 01:03:10,102
I'm aware of my crimes,

862
01:03:11,753 --> 01:03:16,702
and I'll even give my life
to atone for them.

863
01:03:18,263 --> 01:03:22,977
The serpent has arrived to save
the good and eradicate evil.

864
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:30,678
What are you looking at?

865
01:03:32,428 --> 01:03:34,016
Do you want to talk?

866
01:03:35,762 --> 01:03:36,762
Okay, let's talk.

867
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:38,512
Go on.

868
01:03:41,262 --> 01:03:42,928
I know you wouldn't say anything.

869
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:47,595
But today I'll talk
and you'll listen.

870
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:53,428
Who's accountable for the crap
you filled in Chiku's mind?

871
01:03:55,053 --> 01:03:57,553
Poor thing won't stop praising you
even for a minute.

872
01:03:58,095 --> 01:04:00,095
"Father this, Father that."

873
01:04:00,178 --> 01:04:02,303
He thinks you're a superhero.

874
01:04:13,012 --> 01:04:15,345
There's no connection between us.

875
01:04:17,345 --> 01:04:18,345
And...

876
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:23,803
And now it doesn't even matter.

877
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,387
But Chiku's your good son.

878
01:04:31,928 --> 01:04:33,470
He talks to you every day.

879
01:04:36,637 --> 01:04:38,928
Please tell him the truth.

880
01:04:41,137 --> 01:04:42,845
Otherwise, he'll be
heartbroken someday.

881
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,345
Then I'll never forgive you for it.

882
01:04:56,387 --> 01:04:58,720
How will you tell him anything?

883
01:04:59,845 --> 01:05:01,887
It's lights out for you.

884
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:50,803
Shonku, where did get this?

885
01:05:51,303 --> 01:05:53,012
Where did you get it?
Give it here.

886
01:05:53,095 --> 01:05:54,345
Give it here. Give...

887
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,012
Bad boy, Shonku.

888
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,137
When a body
isn't cremated ritually,

889
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:11,803
the spirit latches on to the remains
and turns into a Kichkandi.

890
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:13,678
See...

891
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,762
Brother!
She turns into a Kichkandi.

892
01:06:17,928 --> 01:06:21,595
Father actually trapped her, and now
you've set her free by breaking...

893
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,345
Why can't you
ever be serious, brother?

894
01:06:27,928 --> 01:06:28,928
Okay.

895
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:35,012
Shonku.

896
01:06:40,637 --> 01:06:41,720
Hey, Shonku!

897
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:50,491
Okay.

898
01:07:29,595 --> 01:07:31,803
I couldn't understand
what she was saying.

899
01:07:32,845 --> 01:07:35,387
But whatever it was,
it was under the bed.

900
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,637
That's their favourite spot.

901
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:41,678
This...

902
01:07:42,095 --> 01:07:43,553
This is your expert?

903
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,928
Maya baby, it was Shonku.

904
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,678
Thank you for your concern, Kanu.

905
01:07:50,928 --> 01:07:53,262
I am not able to explain,
but, Chiraunji,

906
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:55,262
can you check it out once?

907
01:07:55,803 --> 01:07:56,803
Trust me.

908
01:08:12,095 --> 01:08:13,512
Brother,
I am getting that feeling again.

909
01:08:14,262 --> 01:08:15,803
This time it's much stronger.

910
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:17,720
I can feel my blood boiling.

911
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:19,928
It's only hormones.

912
01:08:21,762 --> 01:08:23,345
How many times do I tell you?

913
01:08:23,428 --> 01:08:25,218
You and your biology lessons.

914
01:08:29,178 --> 01:08:30,595
She's got style, I tell you.

915
01:08:38,053 --> 01:08:39,387
We're screwed.

916
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,720
Look.

917
01:08:48,303 --> 01:08:51,762
Maya said
her dog brought it here.

918
01:08:52,803 --> 01:08:54,928
Every little thing excites you.

919
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,803
Look closely,
it's remains of Kichkandi,

920
01:08:58,095 --> 01:09:00,678
which you tossed away
in the jungle.

921
01:09:01,126 --> 01:09:02,044
What are you looking at?

922
01:09:02,095 --> 01:09:05,053
You're the reason that Kichkandi
entered this house.

923
01:09:05,137 --> 01:09:07,178
If it's all my fault,

924
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:10,771
then who is to blame for what was
happening in Silawar before we arrived.

925
01:09:14,387 --> 01:09:15,928
-Use some logic.
-No.

926
01:09:17,262 --> 01:09:19,845
I listened to you once,
but not this time.

927
01:09:21,637 --> 01:09:23,682
I must chant
the purification spell.

928
01:09:23,762 --> 01:09:25,512
Quietly stand in a corner.

929
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:26,595
Not a word.

930
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:31,095
And you should learn
how to talk to your elders first.

931
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:33,595
Being taller
doesn't mean you talk back.

932
01:09:33,762 --> 01:09:35,803
I want silence.
Pin-drop silence.

933
01:09:36,095 --> 01:09:37,762
"Silence. Pin-drop silence."

934
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:50,512
Is the purification done?

935
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,845
Can we leave now?

936
01:11:21,387 --> 01:11:23,928
I have tied an enchanted doll
at the front door, Maya.

937
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,512
And also chanted
the purification mantra in your room.

938
01:11:28,553 --> 01:11:30,095
So cute.

939
01:11:30,178 --> 01:11:31,220
Did you hear, Maya?

940
01:11:31,637 --> 01:11:35,053
Thanks to baba's doll,
now we can sleep peacefully.

941
01:11:35,512 --> 01:11:36,512
Come.

942
01:11:36,595 --> 01:11:37,928
If you still feel scared,

943
01:11:38,053 --> 01:11:41,845
then we brothers can sleep inside
to protect you sisters.

944
01:11:42,262 --> 01:11:44,262
And who will protect us from you?

945
01:11:48,678 --> 01:11:50,928
Don't be afraid, Maya.

946
01:11:51,678 --> 01:11:53,720
Tomorrow is the night
of the full moon.

947
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:55,682
Our powers will increase,

948
01:11:55,762 --> 01:11:57,345
and the Kichkandi
will be powerless.

949
01:11:59,637 --> 01:12:02,470
We'll perform the Blood Spirit
ritual to trap her.

950
01:12:02,678 --> 01:12:04,845
It's the ritual our father
performed 27 years ago.

951
01:12:05,095 --> 01:12:07,928
I'll only show my face
after getting rid of the Kichkandi.

952
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:09,387
I promise.

953
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:13,887
Why did you make a commitment?

954
01:12:14,012 --> 01:12:15,137
It was the right thing to do.

955
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,637
Are we really going to perform
a ritual tomorrow?

956
01:12:17,803 --> 01:12:20,928
I thought we'll let this drama
continue, make a strong bill.

957
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:22,595
But you seem eager.

958
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,303
This time
we'll perform the real deal.

959
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:26,803
Fine, I won't stop you.

960
01:12:26,887 --> 01:12:28,720
In fact, you can sacrifice my life.

961
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,762
You can trap my spirit when I turn
into one and claim me as the Kichkandi.

962
01:12:31,928 --> 01:12:33,637
Don't talk about dying, brother.

963
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,053
What else do I do?

964
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,137
When there is no real Kichkandi,

965
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,553
are you going to manufacture
a real one from your backside?

966
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,928
This ritual will be a big flop,
and we'll end up with a jack squat.

967
01:12:44,137 --> 01:12:45,553
GDP's already down.

968
01:12:45,637 --> 01:12:47,845
-You'll ruin our business--
-I'm in charge of this case.

969
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,720
We'll perform the ritual tomorrow.

970
01:12:51,137 --> 01:12:52,678
According to Father's methods.

971
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,803
You won't interfere,
and that's final.

972
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,285
Good night.

973
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:03,720
I wonder where I went wrong
in raising you.

974
01:13:03,803 --> 01:13:05,928
I'll tell you some other day.
Now let me practise.

975
01:14:43,803 --> 01:14:45,762
Greetings, Kichkandi.

976
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,803
Go away.

977
01:14:50,303 --> 01:14:51,970
No...

978
01:14:54,345 --> 01:14:55,387
No.

979
01:16:26,012 --> 01:16:28,178
Thank you, Shahrukh bro.

980
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:33,095
Good evening, Ms. Kichu.

981
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:41,345
-Mr. Manager.
-Hello, baba.

982
01:16:41,553 --> 01:16:44,595
Why are you scaring your madam
dressed as Stree?

983
01:16:52,637 --> 01:16:54,720
And there was lightning
coming from her mouth.

984
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,720
She was singing aloud.

985
01:17:03,137 --> 01:17:04,845
She looked like the mummy.

986
01:17:07,095 --> 01:17:09,470
There's a Kichkandi in my estate.

987
01:17:18,237 --> 01:17:21,558
Sorry, baba,
I only did what madame asked.

988
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:28,595
I must admit,
manager, you've got passion.

989
01:17:29,095 --> 01:17:30,220
Thank you.

990
01:17:30,845 --> 01:17:32,553
Anything for my madame.

991
01:17:35,637 --> 01:17:36,637
-Hari...
-Welcome, madame.

992
01:17:36,678 --> 01:17:37,678
What's the emergency?

993
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,178
Why you're not at the house
scaring Maya?

994
01:17:39,262 --> 01:17:44,262
Salutations from
one cunning mind to another.

995
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:51,682
I gave you one job,
but you couldn't do that either.

996
01:17:51,762 --> 01:17:54,012
Sorry, madame,
but it's not my fault.

997
01:17:54,178 --> 01:17:56,345
Baba is wise. He's too good.

998
01:17:56,428 --> 01:17:59,137
-Shut up!
-It's not his fault.

999
01:17:59,637 --> 01:18:02,470
We see what others don't see.

1000
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:03,845
I told you.

1001
01:18:04,387 --> 01:18:06,512
Come to the point
and tell me what you want.

1002
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,803
I want to be a part of your plan.

1003
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:13,095
You want to sell this property,
don't you?

1004
01:18:13,345 --> 01:18:14,345
Hari!

1005
01:18:14,387 --> 01:18:15,720
I'll help you.

1006
01:18:16,012 --> 01:18:18,637
Fee... Rs. 2 million only.

1007
01:18:18,887 --> 01:18:19,803
Rs. 2 million.

1008
01:18:20,053 --> 01:18:21,137
Madame--

1009
01:18:22,762 --> 01:18:24,178
I'll give you Rs. 101.

1010
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,595
We can always bargain later.

1011
01:18:27,887 --> 01:18:29,053
But I have a question.

1012
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:32,887
You live like a princess,
yet you're so greedy.

1013
01:18:33,387 --> 01:18:36,470
Mind you, baba,
my madame is not greedy.

1014
01:18:37,387 --> 01:18:39,137
Do you know
how much money she owes?

1015
01:18:39,262 --> 01:18:41,095
-Hari--
-What do you want?

1016
01:18:41,387 --> 01:18:43,178
Can't she go shopping in London?

1017
01:18:43,387 --> 01:18:45,345
-Or gamble in Vegas?
-Hari...

1018
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,387
-Or party in Europe?
-Hari!

1019
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:48,720
What do you expect her to do?

1020
01:18:48,803 --> 01:18:50,178
-Sell tea in Palampur?
-Shut up!

1021
01:18:50,262 --> 01:18:52,095
-Shut up and sit over there now!
-But, madame...

1022
01:18:52,345 --> 01:18:56,720
Look, princess,
I can help you achieve

1023
01:18:56,803 --> 01:18:58,803
what you
and your clown here couldn't.

1024
01:18:59,637 --> 01:19:01,470
I'll scare everyone
out of their wits,

1025
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:03,012
and Maya will come up
to you and personally say...

1026
01:19:03,095 --> 01:19:05,387
"Sister, sell the property now."

1027
01:21:13,637 --> 01:21:14,637
Where's the camphor?

1028
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,012
What are you doing, brother?

1029
01:21:16,178 --> 01:21:18,387
Preparing for tonight's ritual.

1030
01:21:20,053 --> 01:21:21,678
The what?

1031
01:21:24,928 --> 01:21:28,137
To what do I owe
this sudden transformation?

1032
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,762
I am cursing myself.

1033
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:33,220
Last night, I had a long discussion
with myself.

1034
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:36,345
-Suddenly, I had a feeling--
-What's your angle in all this?

1035
01:21:36,428 --> 01:21:37,428
Angle?

1036
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,012
It's the right angle, Chiku.

1037
01:21:39,095 --> 01:21:41,595
Your life depends
on only two things.

1038
01:21:42,178 --> 01:21:43,262
Money and lust.

1039
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:44,678
So, what is it this time?

1040
01:21:47,845 --> 01:21:50,345
This time
it's for the tantric knowledge.

1041
01:21:50,428 --> 01:21:51,595
Then swear on me.

1042
01:21:51,887 --> 01:21:52,928
Fine.

1043
01:21:57,553 --> 01:22:01,720
Brother, I knew you will
mend your ways someday.

1044
01:22:02,262 --> 01:22:05,887
I knew you'll quit being a fraud,
cheat,

1045
01:22:06,178 --> 01:22:10,303
a liar, lowlife, useless,
imposter, pervert.

1046
01:22:10,387 --> 01:22:11,387
Enough.

1047
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:14,012
I understand your emotion.

1048
01:22:14,303 --> 01:22:16,345
This is why I love you so much.

1049
01:22:16,762 --> 01:22:19,762
Thank you, brother.
Come on, let's prepare for the ritual.

1050
01:22:19,845 --> 01:22:21,928
Together we'll fight
against the Kichkandi.

1051
01:22:24,347 --> 01:22:25,897
-Speakers...
-Will play.

1052
01:22:25,977 --> 01:22:27,752
-Lanterns...
-Will blow up.

1053
01:22:27,832 --> 01:22:29,387
-Hari...
-Will fly.

1054
01:22:42,262 --> 01:22:43,803
One pill won't help.

1055
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:51,928
He's big and strong.

1056
01:22:53,637 --> 01:22:55,887
You've been taking notice.

1057
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:58,720
Why? Are you jealous?

1058
01:22:59,053 --> 01:23:00,428
Jealous? Me?

1059
01:23:00,678 --> 01:23:03,303
No, no. He's quite innocent.

1060
01:23:03,637 --> 01:23:05,262
Chiku isn't your type.

1061
01:23:05,553 --> 01:23:09,803
Really? And you are.

1062
01:23:11,178 --> 01:23:12,845
I'm a global lover.

1063
01:23:13,303 --> 01:23:14,720
All type is my type.

1064
01:23:15,845 --> 01:23:18,095
I am way out of your league.

1065
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:21,762
Where?

1066
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:26,553
It's always fun to hit on something
out of one's league, madam.

1067
01:23:29,762 --> 01:23:30,887
The yoghurt.

1068
01:23:32,595 --> 01:23:33,678
Feed him.

1069
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:36,637
Go.

1070
01:23:43,512 --> 01:23:44,512
Chiku.

1071
01:23:44,803 --> 01:23:45,803
Chiku.

1072
01:23:46,637 --> 01:23:50,553
Remember when we were still kids
and you would go for your exams.

1073
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,345
I would feed you yoghurt
for good luck.

1074
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,388
When?

1075
01:23:55,553 --> 01:23:57,678
You're going to perform
such a big ritual.

1076
01:23:57,887 --> 01:23:59,845
Have some.

1077
01:24:01,095 --> 01:24:02,137
It's too sweet.

1078
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:05,095
The entire village is gathering around
to watch the ritual.

1079
01:24:32,345 --> 01:24:35,303
I summon thee, fire.

1080
01:24:38,012 --> 01:24:41,595
I summon thee, fire and water.

1081
01:25:04,845 --> 01:25:07,095
Brother, I feel dizzy.

1082
01:25:07,178 --> 01:25:08,637
It's the performance pressure.

1083
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:11,201
Come on, baba,
continue with the ritual.

1084
01:25:11,281 --> 01:25:12,098
Yes...

1085
01:25:24,012 --> 01:25:27,345
Beware! The Kichkandi's around.

1086
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:56,970
Dark energy!

1087
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,637
Dark energy!

1088
01:25:58,762 --> 01:26:00,637
Dark energy!

1089
01:26:07,887 --> 01:26:09,720
What's wrong with baba?

1090
01:26:10,887 --> 01:26:12,220
Chiraunji baba!

1091
01:26:13,052 --> 01:26:14,220
Chiraunji baba!

1092
01:26:14,928 --> 01:26:20,640
No! Kichkandi killed my brother!

1093
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,012
-Hari, now, now, now, go, go, go.
-Okay, madame.

1094
01:26:28,262 --> 01:26:29,595
Kichkandi!

1095
01:26:34,845 --> 01:26:36,220
Chiraunji baba.

1096
01:26:36,762 --> 01:26:37,928
Chiraunji baba!

1097
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:41,762
She's done it.

1098
01:26:43,262 --> 01:26:45,553
The Kichkandi killed my brother.

1099
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:47,720
Baba is dead.

1100
01:26:48,178 --> 01:26:50,012
This spirit is very dangerous.

1101
01:26:51,262 --> 01:26:54,762
If you want to save your lives,
then leave Silawar.

1102
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,012
Run!

1103
01:28:03,053 --> 01:28:04,678
Kanu. Kanu...

1104
01:28:07,637 --> 01:28:08,762
Chiraunji!

1105
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:29,220
Sushil, hurry up. Hurry up.

1106
01:28:29,303 --> 01:28:32,369
Come on. Load everything quickly.

1107
01:28:32,887 --> 01:28:36,031
Hurry up, hurry up.

1108
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,262
When is he coming, Hari?

1109
01:29:03,345 --> 01:29:04,887
Any minute, madame.

1110
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,303
-It's getting late.
-Very late.

1111
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:08,512
Hurry up and pay my fee, princess.

1112
01:29:08,803 --> 01:29:10,762
It's going to be trouble
when Chiku wakes up.

1113
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:12,512
You seem to be in a hurry.

1114
01:29:13,178 --> 01:29:17,595
I thought tonight
we'll watch Naagin together.

1115
01:29:18,137 --> 01:29:19,637
I wish.

1116
01:29:20,678 --> 01:29:22,678
But right now
I only wish to see the cash.

1117
01:29:26,512 --> 01:29:27,637
I understand.

1118
01:29:28,053 --> 01:29:30,262
Hari, get the money from the safe.

1119
01:29:31,803 --> 01:29:32,970
What safe, madame?

1120
01:29:34,762 --> 01:29:36,553
The safe in the other office, Hari.

1121
01:29:40,137 --> 01:29:41,678
Of course, madame.

1122
01:29:42,345 --> 01:29:44,178
I won't take Rs. 2,000 notes,
manager.

1123
01:29:44,678 --> 01:29:46,178
They may become worthless
at any time.

1124
01:29:48,262 --> 01:29:50,178
We could've watched
at least one episode together.

1125
01:29:50,262 --> 01:29:52,095
We could've watched
the entire season together.

1126
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:55,012
But brother before any other.

1127
01:29:57,345 --> 01:29:59,095
What is it with men and me?

1128
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:04,470
Why can't I ever find true love?

1129
01:30:06,637 --> 01:30:09,512
Don't be upset, princess.
Give that here.

1130
01:30:10,553 --> 01:30:11,553
But I--

1131
01:30:11,762 --> 01:30:13,428
I am not watching
your private photos.

1132
01:30:13,512 --> 01:30:15,762
-Just saving my number.
-But--

1133
01:30:16,137 --> 01:30:17,553
We'll continue the affair.

1134
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:21,845
"Special Friend."

1135
01:30:22,637 --> 01:30:23,637
Here you go.

1136
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:26,137
Zoom me whenever you miss me.

1137
01:30:27,762 --> 01:30:31,053
You can't get this personal touch
on Zoom.

1138
01:30:31,637 --> 01:30:33,095
Which other office, madame?

1139
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:38,387
Hari, you're good for nothing.

1140
01:30:39,137 --> 01:30:41,762
Vibhu, wait here.

1141
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,053
I'll go get the cash.

1142
01:30:43,512 --> 01:30:45,970
It's not wise to challenge
someone more cunning than you.

1143
01:30:46,928 --> 01:30:49,845
Let's not mix love and affection
with business.

1144
01:30:51,928 --> 01:30:53,803
-Hurry up and pay my money or--
-Or else?

1145
01:30:55,887 --> 01:31:00,095
Or else I'll tell everyone
how you cheated your sister.

1146
01:31:00,262 --> 01:31:01,595
Oh, really?

1147
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:04,512
And what did you do
with your brother?

1148
01:31:05,345 --> 01:31:06,720
What did you mix in the yoghurt?

1149
01:31:07,262 --> 01:31:09,595
Sleeping pills
to make him fall asleep.

1150
01:31:09,762 --> 01:31:11,721
Then Hari could scare
the villagers--

1151
01:31:11,801 --> 01:31:12,801
Shut up.

1152
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,928
I know what I did.

1153
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,303
Why are you...

1154
01:31:25,928 --> 01:31:28,762
Chiku, listen to me.

1155
01:31:29,595 --> 01:31:30,595
Calm down.

1156
01:31:30,845 --> 01:31:31,928
Take a deep breath.

1157
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:35,345
Not so deep.

1158
01:31:36,262 --> 01:31:38,178
You know what, meditate.

1159
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:40,970
Whatever I did was for your sake.

1160
01:31:42,762 --> 01:31:45,262
Dalai Lama says hello.

1161
01:31:46,762 --> 01:31:50,012
Come on, sir.
Go catch some wanted criminal.

1162
01:31:50,303 --> 01:31:52,095
You'll get a medal for it.

1163
01:31:52,178 --> 01:31:54,470
Why this rude treatment
with us ordinary people?

1164
01:31:55,887 --> 01:31:58,803
I am looking for justice,
not reward.

1165
01:31:59,678 --> 01:32:04,137
You'll pay for your father's sins.

1166
01:32:04,887 --> 01:32:06,220
Did you hear?

1167
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,095
What did our father do, sir?

1168
01:32:09,178 --> 01:32:10,762
What did he do?

1169
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:15,637
I was only 12 years old
when your father got me married.

1170
01:32:16,095 --> 01:32:18,803
To a goat.

1171
01:32:19,262 --> 01:32:20,262
What?

1172
01:32:20,803 --> 01:32:22,637
All this for a goat.

1173
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,970
For seven years in a row,

1174
01:32:25,928 --> 01:32:30,095
he made me marry a goat
in front of the entire village.

1175
01:32:31,663 --> 01:32:34,470
He said
evil spirits were after me.

1176
01:32:34,762 --> 01:32:37,303
He said, whenever I feel scared,
I should bleat like a goat.

1177
01:32:38,512 --> 01:32:39,762
He made a spectacle out of me.

1178
01:32:43,928 --> 01:32:46,053
That's how people laughed at me.

1179
01:32:46,762 --> 01:32:50,762
I became a laughing stock
for the people.

1180
01:32:51,012 --> 01:32:52,762
A statue of shame.

1181
01:32:52,928 --> 01:32:55,262
Father saved your life.

1182
01:32:55,387 --> 01:32:56,845
There must be some kind
of curse on you.

1183
01:32:56,928 --> 01:32:58,887
Be quiet!

1184
01:32:59,053 --> 01:33:01,762
He didn't save my life.
He ruined it.

1185
01:33:01,845 --> 01:33:06,637
Sir, what charge
will you arrest us for?

1186
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,137
Animal husbandry?

1187
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,803
We'll be out
in a couple of months. Sorry.

1188
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:17,845
No arrest, only justice.
Straight encounter.

1189
01:33:18,012 --> 01:33:20,387
I'll shoot you two
when I see a sweet spot.

1190
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,803
Let's talk, sir.

1191
01:33:21,887 --> 01:33:23,970
Father must have had a reason
for what he did.

1192
01:33:24,053 --> 01:33:25,762
There was a curse on your life--

1193
01:33:27,947 --> 01:33:29,158
Chiku!

1194
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:31,091
What are you doing?

1195
01:33:39,053 --> 01:33:41,012
He's still alive.
Let's get out of here.

1196
01:33:53,022 --> 01:33:54,220
Bye, Dhanno.

1197
01:33:56,345 --> 01:33:57,678
Let's catch a train.

1198
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:00,470
Catch whatever you want.
I'm going back to the estate.

1199
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:04,137
Stop bugging me now, Chiraunji.

1200
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:08,637
Even a blind guy
would've realised by now

1201
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,762
that ghosts are not real!

1202
01:34:14,845 --> 01:34:18,637
Ghosts or not,
I'll never be like you.

1203
01:34:20,303 --> 01:34:23,595
I won't let my humanity die.
I'm going back to tell Maya the truth.

1204
01:34:23,678 --> 01:34:25,887
Then just admit
you're crazy about the girl.

1205
01:34:26,137 --> 01:34:27,762
Stop this drama of humanity.

1206
01:34:28,012 --> 01:34:30,220
And stop pretending
to be my brother.

1207
01:34:30,845 --> 01:34:33,970
You always did what you wanted
since we were kids.

1208
01:34:34,512 --> 01:34:35,762
You're the tamer,
and I'm your monkey.

1209
01:34:35,845 --> 01:34:37,262
You say get up, you say sit down.

1210
01:34:37,345 --> 01:34:40,678
You say sing,
you say dance, do this, do that!

1211
01:34:43,012 --> 01:34:45,178
You've never carried out any
responsibility of an older brother,

1212
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:46,803
only used me!

1213
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,720
Today we go our separate ways.

1214
01:35:04,762 --> 01:35:06,723
I wish you had said this
25 years ago,

1215
01:35:06,803 --> 01:35:08,720
and I wouldn't have
wasted my life on you.

1216
01:35:09,678 --> 01:35:13,637
Father left nothing for us
except a torn book and underwear.

1217
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:16,012
I was only 10 years old!

1218
01:35:17,345 --> 01:35:20,762
Even I dreamt of catching spirits,
do you hear?

1219
01:35:22,512 --> 01:35:26,095
But by the time I turned 11,
life taught me some valuable lessons!

1220
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,053
Yes, I'm a bastard!

1221
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,512
But don't call me irresponsible!

1222
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:41,345
I relieve you
from your responsibility.

1223
01:35:42,762 --> 01:35:43,970
Thank you very much.

1224
01:35:50,762 --> 01:35:53,220
Try living without your brother.
We'll see!

1225
01:35:57,845 --> 01:35:59,095
Ungrateful boy!

1226
01:36:10,762 --> 01:36:13,762
I want this estate sold in a week.

1227
01:36:14,303 --> 01:36:16,220
-Enough of this horror show.
-Yes, madame.

1228
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:20,470
Haven't the workers left yet?

1229
01:36:20,762 --> 01:36:22,012
Let's go take a look.

1230
01:36:34,137 --> 01:36:35,887
Isn't that Maya madam?

1231
01:36:36,345 --> 01:36:38,595
What is she doing?

1232
01:36:41,387 --> 01:36:45,512
I think it's come
as a big shock to her.

1233
01:36:45,887 --> 01:36:48,345
Don't worry. I'll handle her.

1234
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:53,762
Maya, we are gonna have
so much fun in London.

1235
01:36:54,512 --> 01:36:55,739
Mayu.

1236
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,053
Maya, stop overreacting now
and look at me.

1237
01:37:00,262 --> 01:37:01,303
Madam...

1238
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:06,178
Maya.

1239
01:37:07,262 --> 01:37:08,387
Maya.

1240
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:16,720
Maya!

1241
01:37:18,512 --> 01:37:19,887
Titliya...

1242
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,470
I should've never come
to this damned place.

1243
01:37:38,178 --> 01:37:41,887
Sweetie, what are you doing here
at this hour?

1244
01:37:42,387 --> 01:37:44,387
Are you leaving Silawar
with your family?

1245
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:46,762
Got separated?

1246
01:37:47,887 --> 01:37:50,845
No, this is no time to play.

1247
01:37:51,387 --> 01:37:53,262
Do you know
how to get to the station?

1248
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,345
Come with me.

1249
01:37:58,178 --> 01:38:00,178
I'll reunite you with your family
at the station.

1250
01:38:03,762 --> 01:38:08,512
This is why I say love, affection,
family are all illusions.

1251
01:38:08,803 --> 01:38:10,345
There's only one reality.

1252
01:38:10,595 --> 01:38:13,220
We are all going
to die alone eventually.

1253
01:38:15,053 --> 01:38:18,887
You're still very young.
You have a long life ahead of you.

1254
01:38:26,595 --> 01:38:28,178
Do you have any siblings?

1255
01:38:28,762 --> 01:38:30,928
No? Very good. Very good.

1256
01:38:31,512 --> 01:38:33,012
I have a kid brother, Chiku.

1257
01:38:33,095 --> 01:38:37,345
I raised and fed him,
and now he calls me irresponsible.

1258
01:38:39,678 --> 01:38:41,512
I guess
he feels a lot of pressure.

1259
01:38:43,178 --> 01:38:44,595
I won't let him do it.

1260
01:38:52,137 --> 01:38:55,054
Think about your father.
You'll be meeting him soon.

1261
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:57,512
What are you doing, sir?
Lower the gun.

1262
01:38:58,512 --> 01:39:01,012
Don't shoot.
You might hit the child.

1263
01:39:01,303 --> 01:39:03,678
Child? What child?

1264
01:39:03,762 --> 01:39:04,803
This one, sir.

1265
01:39:05,053 --> 01:39:06,470
Her name is Titli.

1266
01:39:06,762 --> 01:39:08,345
Say hello to uncle.

1267
01:39:25,762 --> 01:39:27,137
What are you doing?

1268
01:39:27,512 --> 01:39:28,887
Killing you.

1269
01:39:39,762 --> 01:39:41,512
What's happening?

1270
01:39:41,637 --> 01:39:43,095
What is it? Oh, no!

1271
01:39:44,762 --> 01:39:45,970
What are you doing?

1272
01:40:21,749 --> 01:40:24,387
Gho...

1273
01:40:24,762 --> 01:40:26,928
Ghost!

1274
01:40:27,095 --> 01:40:31,595
"Dear Lord,
save me from evil spirits."

1275
01:40:31,678 --> 01:40:36,387
"Dear Lord,
save me from evil spirits."

1276
01:40:46,762 --> 01:40:48,553
Chiku! Chiku, wait!

1277
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:54,928
Bloody drunkard. Why do you
always hang outside our tent?

1278
01:40:56,762 --> 01:40:58,762
Look, you're twitching again.

1279
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:02,887
It's not a twitch.
There's bad energy around.

1280
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:04,512
There's no energy around!

1281
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,970
Chiku!

1282
01:41:08,137 --> 01:41:09,678
Hurry up, or we'll miss the bus.

1283
01:41:09,762 --> 01:41:12,512
-Yeah...
-Don't look around. Look ahead.

1284
01:41:15,595 --> 01:41:17,012
Baba...

1285
01:41:19,637 --> 01:41:20,928
Baba's turned into a ghost!

1286
01:41:21,262 --> 01:41:24,178
Baba's turned
into a ghost too! Run!

1287
01:41:24,345 --> 01:41:25,553
-Wait.
-Vinod!

1288
01:41:25,845 --> 01:41:26,970
Vinod, Lata!

1289
01:41:33,095 --> 01:41:34,845
What's happening, Father?

1290
01:41:36,095 --> 01:41:39,053
You said I should have faith,
and that's what I did!

1291
01:41:39,345 --> 01:41:40,720
Was it all a lie?

1292
01:41:45,262 --> 01:41:47,678
Say something! Give me an answer!

1293
01:41:48,262 --> 01:41:50,678
Give me a sign,
or else I'll tear this book!

1294
01:41:52,762 --> 01:41:55,303
Give me a sign,
or else I'll tear this book.

1295
01:41:56,928 --> 01:41:58,470
Give me a sign...

1296
01:41:59,595 --> 01:42:01,553
Give me a sign, Father.

1297
01:42:02,137 --> 01:42:05,178
-Give me a sign...
-Chiku!

1298
01:42:05,762 --> 01:42:07,345
You were right!

1299
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:09,678
Chiku!

1300
01:42:11,387 --> 01:42:12,595
You were right, Chiku.

1301
01:42:13,928 --> 01:42:15,178
Ghosts are real.

1302
01:42:16,928 --> 01:42:19,637
I apologise. I beg you.

1303
01:42:20,345 --> 01:42:21,345
Don't leave me alone.

1304
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:22,678
What new drama is this?
Leave me alone.

1305
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,012
It's true, brother.

1306
01:42:25,053 --> 01:42:27,762
You're the antenna that senses ghosts,
and I'm the X-ray.

1307
01:42:28,678 --> 01:42:30,053
I saw it with my own eyes.

1308
01:42:30,512 --> 01:42:33,637
Kichkandi... in the jungle.

1309
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,720
I swear on our father.

1310
01:42:36,751 --> 01:42:37,669
Another lie.

1311
01:42:37,762 --> 01:42:40,178
I'll die if I'm lying.

1312
01:42:43,553 --> 01:42:46,595
Every time you get that feeling,
those twitches,

1313
01:42:46,762 --> 01:42:48,512
I see a bloody ghost.

1314
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:50,845
I've been seeing them all my life.

1315
01:42:51,053 --> 01:42:53,637
Now I finally understand
the connection, Chiku.

1316
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:56,137
Grandpa, the dog, the drunkard...

1317
01:43:00,845 --> 01:43:02,970
I see dead people!

1318
01:43:06,012 --> 01:43:07,845
This... This one...

1319
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:10,720
You are twitching again.
That means...

1320
01:43:10,928 --> 01:43:12,762
It's just my hormones, brother.

1321
01:43:13,137 --> 01:43:14,387
No, my child.

1322
01:43:17,762 --> 01:43:19,720
This means there's a--

1323
01:43:24,345 --> 01:43:26,682
Hello, police.
Please don't disconnect the call.

1324
01:43:26,762 --> 01:43:27,678
-Madame...
-I can't wait till morning.

1325
01:43:27,762 --> 01:43:29,553
-Come right now.
-Please stop her, madame. Please...

1326
01:43:29,637 --> 01:43:31,887
-Shut up, Hari. I'm on the phone.
-It's the real Kichkandi.

1327
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:34,137
Listen to me, please.
Oh, my God!

1328
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:37,470
Madam Kichkandi, I have
no idea about what you're saying.

1329
01:43:37,553 --> 01:43:38,970
No idea!

1330
01:43:48,637 --> 01:43:49,762
Anybody there?

1331
01:44:10,678 --> 01:44:11,637
Chiku.

1332
01:44:15,553 --> 01:44:16,762
What am I going to do?

1333
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:30,970
Shut up.

1334
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:33,793
She will come back.

1335
01:44:33,845 --> 01:44:34,928
-Madam.
-Get in.

1336
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:36,470
Shut up and get in here.

1337
01:44:40,012 --> 01:44:41,928
Who did this
to your beautiful face?

1338
01:44:42,012 --> 01:44:43,220
Shut up!

1339
01:44:44,053 --> 01:44:46,053
-Who did this?
-Maya did.

1340
01:44:46,637 --> 01:44:47,637
Maya?

1341
01:44:48,553 --> 01:44:50,303
She's possessed.

1342
01:44:50,762 --> 01:44:52,512
She took Hari.

1343
01:44:54,137 --> 01:44:57,637
I was pretending,
but this is a real Kichkandi.

1344
01:45:00,137 --> 01:45:02,410
-Is this your fault?
-No...

1345
01:45:02,506 --> 01:45:04,220
Now you must save my sister.

1346
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:06,845
-Chiku.
-Yeah?

1347
01:45:07,345 --> 01:45:08,887
Do a replay of Father's ritual.

1348
01:45:09,512 --> 01:45:11,789
It's not a concert
we can do again.

1349
01:45:13,303 --> 01:45:16,095
Kichkandi is now inside Maya.

1350
01:45:17,428 --> 01:45:18,595
Her life is in danger.

1351
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:21,928
If I repeat Father's ritual, then
she may suffer the same fate as Manju.

1352
01:45:22,553 --> 01:45:24,178
Don't take Maya for a weakling.

1353
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,762
New-age women are strong.

1354
01:45:27,303 --> 01:45:29,762
-Woman power.
-What is wrong with you?

1355
01:45:30,053 --> 01:45:31,637
But if we don't perform the ritual,

1356
01:45:33,178 --> 01:45:35,283
the Kichkandi will kill Maya.

1357
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:53,637
Maya!

1358
01:45:54,512 --> 01:45:55,512
Maya!

1359
01:45:56,845 --> 01:45:59,053
It's me, Chiraunji.

1360
01:46:01,345 --> 01:46:04,220
Bloody Kichkandi, show yourself!

1361
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,845
Oh, my God!

1362
01:46:09,845 --> 01:46:10,762
Come on, read the spell.

1363
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:21,970
Chedi?

1364
01:46:22,053 --> 01:46:23,178
There you are.

1365
01:46:23,428 --> 01:46:25,970
Very good. Safe and sound.

1366
01:46:26,803 --> 01:46:28,512
There's a ghost out there.

1367
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:31,262
It's safer to stay inside.

1368
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:41,970
What?

1369
01:46:43,428 --> 01:46:45,345
-Back...
-No going back.

1370
01:46:45,637 --> 01:46:47,012
Only forward.

1371
01:46:48,762 --> 01:46:50,637
Titliya.

1372
01:47:03,178 --> 01:47:04,553
Going up?

1373
01:47:06,387 --> 01:47:07,428
Maya...

1374
01:47:11,428 --> 01:47:13,470
Titliya.

1375
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:17,748
Where are you?

1376
01:47:18,845 --> 01:47:25,804
O spirit, I am the son-in-law
of the great God Naigamesh.

1377
01:47:28,678 --> 01:47:32,008
I request you to let me go.

1378
01:47:36,914 --> 01:47:38,303
Maya.

1379
01:47:41,803 --> 01:47:42,887
Glory to Ullat Baba!

1380
01:47:43,137 --> 01:47:44,303
Glory to Ullat Baba!

1381
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:46,762
I finally understood what he meant.

1382
01:47:47,095 --> 01:47:48,303
Glory to Ullat Baba!

1383
01:47:53,137 --> 01:47:55,012
Baba was an awesome tantric.

1384
01:47:55,303 --> 01:47:58,345
Brother,
this is worse than it looks.

1385
01:47:58,637 --> 01:48:00,262
Maya is completely possessed.

1386
01:48:00,345 --> 01:48:01,428
What?

1387
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,012
Final stage.

1388
01:48:03,887 --> 01:48:05,470
I feel... Brother!

1389
01:48:06,637 --> 01:48:07,762
Chiku!

1390
01:48:27,928 --> 01:48:30,553
Maya... I'm Chiraunji.

1391
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:35,137
Remember? Chiraunji.

1392
01:48:36,387 --> 01:48:38,720
-Chi...
-Raunji.

1393
01:48:40,345 --> 01:48:41,428
Chiraunji.

1394
01:48:42,262 --> 01:48:44,762
I'll read one spell
and fix everything.

1395
01:48:46,845 --> 01:48:49,012
Give me a hand, will you?

1396
01:48:49,178 --> 01:48:51,262
This one, next page. One second.

1397
01:49:07,706 --> 01:49:08,928
Hey, Kichu!

1398
01:49:17,137 --> 01:49:19,387
Don't touch my Chiku.

1399
01:49:25,012 --> 01:49:27,053
Kichu, go.

1400
01:49:32,411 --> 01:49:34,512
Oh, my God.
Somebody help us.

1401
01:49:34,637 --> 01:49:37,345
Maya, Maya, please stand up.

1402
01:49:37,428 --> 01:49:39,762
Maya, please.
You're my princess, Maya.

1403
01:49:39,845 --> 01:49:41,595
My little princess.

1404
01:49:45,887 --> 01:49:49,345
No! So sorry, so sorry.

1405
01:49:52,246 --> 01:49:56,095
Vibhooti, do something, you idiot!

1406
01:49:56,428 --> 01:50:00,262
-Mayu, Mayu.
-Chiku!

1407
01:50:03,137 --> 01:50:05,512
Stop it, Maya! Enough!

1408
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:10,053
Maya, sisters often fight.

1409
01:50:11,178 --> 01:50:13,303
That doesn't mean
you become a witch.

1410
01:50:13,845 --> 01:50:16,637
Come on, throw the bitch witch out.

1411
01:50:18,151 --> 01:50:19,928
Chiku!

1412
01:50:23,095 --> 01:50:24,595
Brother.

1413
01:50:27,602 --> 01:50:29,345
Chiku!

1414
01:50:30,803 --> 01:50:32,553
Where the hell are you?

1415
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:34,845
She's got me hanging in mid-air.

1416
01:50:35,762 --> 01:50:37,682
Recite the spell.

1417
01:50:37,762 --> 01:50:39,553
Coming, wait just a minute.

1418
01:50:57,095 --> 01:50:58,387
Brother...

1419
01:50:58,762 --> 01:51:01,887
Brother's dying. Do something.

1420
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:04,095
What can I do without the book?

1421
01:51:04,387 --> 01:51:06,470
Have some faith.

1422
01:51:07,178 --> 01:51:09,178
Take a chance, you fool.

1423
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:43,665
Titliya.

1424
01:52:56,617 --> 01:52:57,784
Maya!

1425
01:52:58,742 --> 01:53:02,117
Maya! Oh, my God!
Maya, are you okay?

1426
01:53:02,617 --> 01:53:03,617
Maya.

1427
01:53:03,742 --> 01:53:04,742
Maya.

1428
01:53:04,784 --> 01:53:07,409
Maya. Hello, are you there?

1429
01:53:07,867 --> 01:53:08,867
Hi...

1430
01:53:09,492 --> 01:53:10,659
Mayu.

1431
01:53:18,409 --> 01:53:20,200
Kichkandi juice!

1432
01:53:25,117 --> 01:53:26,534
Chiku, the towel.

1433
01:53:28,909 --> 01:53:31,159
Mayu, I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Mayu.

1434
01:53:31,242 --> 01:53:35,159
Chiku, you're more awesome
than our father.

1435
01:53:35,409 --> 01:53:37,704
Got rid of the Kichkandi
without any of the frills.

1436
01:53:37,784 --> 01:53:39,200
I didn't get rid of her,

1437
01:53:40,325 --> 01:53:41,575
but Maya's safe now.

1438
01:53:42,575 --> 01:53:43,950
What do you mean
you didn't get rid of her?

1439
01:53:45,867 --> 01:53:46,867
Where is she?

1440
01:53:47,534 --> 01:53:48,534
She's inside me.

1441
01:53:52,534 --> 01:53:54,575
-What happened?
-Have you lost your mind?

1442
01:53:54,784 --> 01:53:57,534
No, brother.
I recited the Stanantrit spell.

1443
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:01,659
It was the spirit transfer spell.

1444
01:54:02,617 --> 01:54:04,034
Spirit transfer spell.

1445
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:07,409
The Kichkandi left Maya's body,
and now she's inside me.

1446
01:54:07,492 --> 01:54:10,409
And I'm a tantric.
I can control her.

1447
01:54:11,284 --> 01:54:13,284
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

1448
01:54:18,617 --> 01:54:19,867
What's happening now?

1449
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:21,450
But this is normal.

1450
01:54:23,534 --> 01:54:24,534
Hormones.

1451
01:54:24,575 --> 01:54:26,867
-What's happening to me?
-I...

1452
01:54:36,742 --> 01:54:38,450
Oh, my God. Get up. Get up.

1453
01:54:39,034 --> 01:54:40,034
Get up.

1454
01:54:41,825 --> 01:54:46,409
Why is this creepy creeper
coming out of my mouth?

1455
01:54:46,492 --> 01:54:49,700
I mistakenly stuck her inside you.

1456
01:54:55,034 --> 01:54:56,992
I will shove a stick
up your behind.

1457
01:54:57,075 --> 01:54:59,867
Don't get mad, brother.
You said take a chance.

1458
01:54:59,950 --> 01:55:02,450
-So, I took a chance.
-Get her out!

1459
01:55:03,694 --> 01:55:04,798
Brother...

1460
01:55:16,034 --> 01:55:17,417
Chiku...

1461
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:18,834
run.

1462
01:55:22,784 --> 01:55:24,594
Brother... Vibhooti...

1463
01:55:47,742 --> 01:55:49,575
No, I'm the only one left now.

1464
01:55:49,659 --> 01:55:50,784
-Come on.
-My brother--

1465
01:55:50,867 --> 01:55:52,117
Bloody amateurs.

1466
01:56:00,867 --> 01:56:02,159
Chiraunji.

1467
01:56:03,075 --> 01:56:04,367
I cannot leave my brother alone.

1468
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:05,867
No, Chiraunji, it's too dangerous.

1469
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:07,825
-Take her away from here. Go.
-Yes, he's right.

1470
01:56:07,992 --> 01:56:09,284
Come on, Maya.
Let's get out of here.

1471
01:56:17,950 --> 01:56:18,992
Come on, Maya.

1472
01:56:21,534 --> 01:56:22,575
Kanu.

1473
01:56:22,787 --> 01:56:24,431
What the hell was that?

1474
01:56:24,659 --> 01:56:25,950
Oh, my God. It's Hari.

1475
01:56:27,784 --> 01:56:30,242
Wake up, Hari. Wake up.

1476
01:56:30,534 --> 01:56:32,492
-Hari, wake up.
-No, no, let me stay unconscious.

1477
01:56:32,784 --> 01:56:34,367
Wake up, Hari! Get up.

1478
01:56:35,034 --> 01:56:35,868
Idiot.

1479
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:37,575
Madam Kichkandi.

1480
01:56:37,784 --> 01:56:40,075
She is only madam now,
not Kichkandi.

1481
01:56:40,242 --> 01:56:41,784
Vibhooti is the Kichkandi now.

1482
01:56:43,284 --> 01:56:44,617
Baba Kichkandi.

1483
01:56:47,075 --> 01:56:48,784
Kanu... I just remembered.

1484
01:56:49,075 --> 01:56:52,450
I was burning,
and there was a tree and...

1485
01:56:52,534 --> 01:56:54,659
Okay, that's great. Let's go.

1486
01:56:55,075 --> 01:56:57,075
The window's open.
Hari, help me.

1487
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:04,956
Brother.

1488
01:57:19,242 --> 01:57:20,534
Brother.

1489
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:23,617
Listen to me, brother.

1490
01:57:27,784 --> 01:57:28,784
Brother.

1491
01:57:30,825 --> 01:57:31,909
Brother.

1492
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:35,325
You're a tantric.

1493
01:57:36,492 --> 01:57:37,784
Fight back.

1494
01:57:55,784 --> 01:57:57,534
Forgive me, Chiku,

1495
01:57:58,409 --> 01:58:00,617
but I don't have an option.

1496
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:04,367
Listen to me, brother...

1497
01:58:04,784 --> 01:58:05,992
Wait.

1498
01:58:07,575 --> 01:58:09,034
Listen to me, brother.

1499
01:58:12,784 --> 01:58:14,325
Fight back, brother.

1500
01:58:22,659 --> 01:58:23,909
Titliya!

1501
01:58:28,325 --> 01:58:29,867
She doesn't want to harm anyone.

1502
01:58:30,784 --> 01:58:32,242
She's in pain herself.

1503
01:58:32,992 --> 01:58:34,450
Help her, Chiraunji.

1504
01:58:59,575 --> 01:59:01,367
Let me understand your pain.

1505
01:59:09,117 --> 01:59:11,242
I can feel your pain.

1506
01:59:13,659 --> 01:59:15,409
I can feel your pain.

1507
01:59:50,617 --> 01:59:51,950
Mother!

1508
01:59:55,534 --> 01:59:57,450
Come, Titli.

1509
02:00:15,450 --> 02:00:16,909
Hide in there, Titli.

1510
02:00:19,409 --> 02:00:21,242
I'll come back for you.

1511
02:00:21,659 --> 02:00:28,909
O butterfly
Which direction do you go?

1512
02:00:35,593 --> 02:00:37,096
Go, hide there.

1513
02:00:53,154 --> 02:00:54,192
Titli.

1514
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:57,159
Titli.

1515
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:05,284
Titli.

1516
02:01:07,617 --> 02:01:09,284
Vibhooti knows Titli.

1517
02:01:11,450 --> 02:01:12,534
He does.

1518
02:01:18,784 --> 02:01:20,617
Titliya!

1519
02:01:20,784 --> 02:01:22,659
-Titliya!
-Titliya!

1520
02:01:22,784 --> 02:01:23,867
Titliya!

1521
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,742
Titliya!

1522
02:01:36,367 --> 02:01:37,575
Titliya!

1523
02:01:38,575 --> 02:01:39,909
Titliya!

1524
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,117
-Titliya!
-Titliya!

1525
02:01:43,534 --> 02:01:44,784
Titliya!

1526
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:47,825
-Titliya!
-Titliya!

1527
02:01:52,901 --> 02:01:53,901
Mother.

1528
02:01:55,492 --> 02:01:56,909
She's here.

1529
02:02:04,367 --> 02:02:05,659
Mother.

1530
02:02:12,034 --> 02:02:13,492
Mother.

1531
02:02:14,617 --> 02:02:16,534
Mother, where are you?

1532
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:20,242
She's here.

1533
02:02:22,867 --> 02:02:24,284
Call out to her.

1534
02:02:25,784 --> 02:02:26,992
She will come.

1535
02:02:27,157 --> 02:02:28,534
She will recognise her mother.

1536
02:02:28,742 --> 02:02:30,575
Finish what you started. Call her.

1537
02:02:36,534 --> 02:02:42,367
O butterfly
Which direction do you go?

1538
02:02:42,895 --> 02:02:51,143
Are you going left
Or are you going right?

1539
02:03:13,354 --> 02:03:14,662
Mother!

1540
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:23,450
Titliya.

1541
02:03:24,075 --> 02:03:25,909
Mother!

1542
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,617
They are leaving, Chiku.

1543
02:04:16,367 --> 02:04:17,534
Brother...

1544
02:04:19,034 --> 02:04:20,117
Are you okay?

1545
02:04:25,117 --> 02:04:29,367
You helped mother and daughter
attain salvation.

1546
02:04:31,450 --> 02:04:32,950
We did, Chiku.

1547
02:04:35,117 --> 02:04:36,752
We did it together.

1548
02:04:46,825 --> 02:04:47,992
Glory to Ullat Baba!

1549
02:04:48,117 --> 02:04:49,284
Glory to Ullat Baba!

1550
02:04:49,364 --> 02:04:51,412
Glory to Vibhooti and Chiraunji!

1551
02:04:51,492 --> 02:04:53,242
I am an ordinary policeman.

1552
02:04:53,409 --> 02:04:55,534
You guys are
the ghost police!

1553
02:04:55,825 --> 02:04:58,492
Ghost police!

1554
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:00,450
Ghost police!

1555
02:05:32,356 --> 02:05:34,315
Here comes Bhoot Police

1556
02:05:34,398 --> 02:05:37,981
It's a duel between two eyes

1557
02:05:39,190 --> 02:05:42,856
There's nothing evil about it

1558
02:05:43,648 --> 02:05:47,148
It's a duel between two eyes

1559
02:05:48,273 --> 02:05:51,565
There's nothing evil about it

1560
02:05:52,731 --> 02:05:55,190
I lost everything

1561
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:57,315
You intoxicate me

1562
02:05:57,395 --> 02:06:01,565
As I immersed myself in your eyes

1563
02:06:01,928 --> 02:06:04,356
Destructive love

1564
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:11,086
Destructive love

1565
02:06:11,166 --> 02:06:13,231
Life's in peril

1566
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:17,648
Your love's robbed me clean

1567
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:20,190
Destructive love

1568
02:06:20,270 --> 02:06:22,523
There's no way out

1569
02:06:22,606 --> 02:06:26,773
Your love's robbed me clean

1570
02:06:27,029 --> 02:06:29,273
Destructive love

1571
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,890
My love's dangerous

1572
02:06:40,974 --> 02:06:43,140
Your heart won't know

1573
02:06:43,265 --> 02:06:47,349
This love's filled
With joy and pain

1574
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:49,890
Fix your eyes on me

1575
02:06:50,057 --> 02:06:52,265
And listen clearly

1576
02:06:52,349 --> 02:06:56,432
My love's filled
With loyalty and betrayal

1577
02:06:56,682 --> 02:06:59,224
I am totally floored by you

1578
02:06:59,307 --> 02:07:01,474
Believe me when I say

1579
02:07:01,557 --> 02:07:05,807
I'm completely immersed
In your love

1580
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:08,015
Destructive love

1581
02:07:12,993 --> 02:07:15,159
My heart knows

1582
02:07:15,243 --> 02:07:17,493
And also believes

1583
02:07:17,576 --> 02:07:21,534
Down the path of love
One loses and gains

1584
02:07:22,076 --> 02:07:24,326
It sets you free

1585
02:07:24,409 --> 02:07:26,534
It dooms you for life

1586
02:07:26,618 --> 02:07:30,743
Love's not easy
But it's also not difficult

1587
02:07:31,159 --> 02:07:33,076
Don't chase after the storm

1588
02:07:33,159 --> 02:07:35,326
Wait at the shore

1589
02:07:35,743 --> 02:07:40,159
Don't lose yourself
In the depths of love

1590
02:07:40,243 --> 02:07:42,576
Destructive love

1591
02:07:46,951 --> 02:07:49,288
Destructive love

1592
02:07:49,368 --> 02:07:51,409
There's no way out

1593
02:07:51,493 --> 02:07:55,576
Your love's robbed me clean

1594
02:07:56,201 --> 02:07:58,451
Destructive love

1595
02:08:05,326 --> 02:08:07,618
Here comes Bhoot Police

1596
02:08:11,951 --> 02:08:13,201
International.

1597
02:08:15,034 --> 02:08:18,118
Hello, Bhoot Police Private Ltd.
at your service.

1598
02:08:18,534 --> 02:08:19,659
How can we help you?

1599
02:08:22,201 --> 02:08:23,201
Werewolf?

1600
02:08:23,618 --> 02:08:24,868
Vampire too?

1601
02:08:25,243 --> 02:08:26,951
No need to worry.

1602
02:08:27,034 --> 02:08:31,326
First things first, book three
business class tickets for Scotland.

1603
02:08:31,515 --> 02:08:34,159
Yes. I'll text you
