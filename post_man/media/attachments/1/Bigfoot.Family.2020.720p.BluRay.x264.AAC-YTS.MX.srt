<i>Every family is weird.</i>

8
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:47,733
<i>But trust me,
mine is the weirdest.</i>

9
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:50,358
<i>My mom is pretty normal,
but my dad...</i>

10
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:51,525
<i>is Bigfoot.</i>

11
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:54,233
<i>Yes. The Bigfoot.</i>

12
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:57,317
<i>I don't look it
but I'm a Bigfoot too.</i>

13
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,442
<i>I got all of the magical powers,
but luckily none of the fur.</i>

14
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,400
<i>What powers?
Like the name Bigfoot implies,</i>

15
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:06,775
<i>I've got big feet.</i>

16
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:11,275
<i>They were annoying at first.
I went through a lot shoes.</i>

17
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,108
<i>But barefoot, these babies can move.</i>

18
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:22,442
Wow.

19
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,275
Hi...
Yes, I am with Adam.

20
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:26,858
<i>I got great hearing.</i>

21
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,442
Yeah, he is so cute.

22
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,317
But he's very shy.

23
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,317
What?

24
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,900
<i>Sometimes embarrassingly so.</i>

25
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:39,567
<i>Also, Bigfoots have the power to heal.</i>

26
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,983
<i>It's handy for all injuries.
We save a ton on medical bills.</i>

27
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:49,067
<i>And there's one more thing,
I can talk to animals.</i>

28
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,108
Morning Adam.

29
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:54,025
Hey Wilbur.
Don't use up the hot water.

30
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,900
Uh-uh. Not my fault.

31
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:59,108
Look at me,
I've got a lot of surface area.

32
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:00,900
<i>We live with animals.</i>

33
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,650
<i>They were friends with my dad
in the forest.</i>

34
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,900
<i>Now they're family.</i>

35
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,233
We're making pancakes,
you hungry?

36
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,358
- Hit me.
- Here.

37
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:12,817
Go for it.

38
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,942
Woah... Oh.

39
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,067
- Thanks.
- Nice catch.

40
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,983
My pleasure.

41
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:23,150
Morning everyone.
Adam, clean your bathroom.

42
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,525
There's so much hair.

43
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,317
- Not mine.
- Have a pancake.

44
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,358
Oh, shoot.

45
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:32,192
Uh, Trapper, what did I say
about throwing food?

46
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,442
Come on, that was a great toss.

47
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,400
Your fault you can't catch.

48
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:39,317
Having said that...

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
What'd he say?

50
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:44,733
<i>My mom can't talk to animals,
so it's up to me keep the peace.</i>

51
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:49,025
Trapper says he is so sorry,
and you look lovely this morning.

52
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:52,608
I didn't say that.
Don't misrepresent me.

53
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:57,900
Like I said: my family is the weirdest.

54
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,775
You know,
for such a big fella,

55
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:04,733
you sure drink a tiny cup of coffee.

56
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:07,692
Any more,
and I won't hibernate for a year.

57
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:11,942
Personally, I need a bit more
of a kick in the morning.

58
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:16,483
Oh. It's almost time.
Where's the remote?

59
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,025
I'm on it.

60
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,775
<i>We're taking care of the environment.</i>

61
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:23,983
<i>Clean oil by X-TRAKT.</i>

62
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:31,358
You're watching <i>Good Morning World.</i>

63
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:33,025
I'm Becky Dabmore.

64
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:36,025
My next guest needs no introduction,

65
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,400
but I'll introduce him anyway.

66
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:41,692
He's come out
of the woodwork, literally.

67
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,358
And here he is, the man
everyone's talking about...

68
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:46,650
Bigfoot.

69
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:56,525
Ooh. I'm loving the new look.

70
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:59,108
It's an upgrade over the jean shorts.

71
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,900
Thanks Becky.

72
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:05,483
There weren't fancy clothing shops
when I was hiding in the forest.

73
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,400
So, I've got to start with the question
that is on everyone's mind.

74
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:14,775
Where have you been all these years?

75
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,400
Well, it's a complicated story.

76
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:20,733
I was a scientist
studying genetic sequencing,

77
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,608
when an experiment went wrong.

78
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:27,317
My DNA mutated
and turned me into Bigfoot.

79
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,900
I think we can all agree, oof,

80
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:34,025
you make those mutations
look good. Ugh.

81
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:35,858
Am I right ladies?

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,233
Yes.

83
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:39,733
Now where were we?

84
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,275
I hid when I was being hunted
by a pharmaceutical company.

85
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:47,567
They wanted to take me
and study my genetic mutation.

86
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,192
But when they were brought down,
I could come live with my family again.

87
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:55,108
That must have been a shock for them.

88
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:57,442
I owe it all to my son, Adam.

89
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,942
He tracked me down
and brought me home.

90
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,525
Oh, I hate that picture.

91
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,317
I can see why.
But don't feel bad.

92
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,900
Not everyone's as photogenic as me.

93
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:12,650
Look at my face,
I don't have a bad side.

94
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,108
Shh. Stop talking.

95
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:18,150
<i>It's amazing to finally be back home.</i>

96
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,358
And better
if you were ever here.

97
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:22,567
Oh come on, be supportive.

98
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,525
Even though you're not climbing
trees all day,

99
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:29,233
ooh, you are still in incredible shape.

100
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:31,858
Getting a little handsy there, Becky.

101
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:34,358
- Your muscles are so big.
- Ugh.

102
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,650
You're in such incredible shape.

103
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:37,775
Bleh.

104
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,942
- Where's your support?
- Don't use my words against me.

105
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:43,567
So, you're a big star now.

106
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,817
I am not so sure about that.

107
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:48,108
Oh, come on.

108
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,650
We all want a piece of those big feet.

109
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:51,775
What's next?

110
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:55,358
Clothing line? Sneaker endorsement?
Video game deal?

111
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,025
I should introduce you
to my agent.

112
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:04,817
You know, I just want to find a way

113
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,733
to make the world better.

114
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,942
Aww. That is so sweet.

115
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,775
Ladies and gentlemen, Bigfoot.

116
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,108
That was a lovely interview.

117
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:20,692
Bigfoot came off like such a gentleman.

118
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:22,317
I thought he looked puffy.

119
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,067
Did they blow dry his fur?

120
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,567
This is why I think
he needs a full time road manager.

121
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,442
Oh, let me guess,
you want the job?

122
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,733
Naturally. I've got an eye for show biz.

123
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,317
The glitz, the glamor.

124
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,067
Maybe he should get a road manager
who doesn't have fleas.

125
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,983
Hey!

126
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,900
My fleas have more integrity
than half the people in this business.

127
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:46,442
Alright, time's up. You've got school.

128
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,233
Yeah, great.

129
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:56,192
Adam! Can your dad sign my poster?

130
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,483
Can Bigfoot come to my birthday party?

131
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:00,983
But just him, to keep it small.

132
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,525
Your dad is like super duper cool.

133
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,650
Can you him give my letter?

134
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:09,483
Children, disperse from this hallway
immediately!

135
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:12,692
You're violating fire code.

136
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:15,942
Adam, you and I go way back.

137
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,400
We understand each other.

138
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,733
You suspended me two months ago.

139
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,067
Oh, Adam.

140
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,692
That was just
an administrative error.

141
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,942
But you're the administrator.

142
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,150
Be that as it may,
could you do me a solid

143
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,483
and get your dad to sign this picture?

144
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:37,483
- Make it out to "Principal Jones".
- Hold on.

145
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,567
- No...
- Not now.

146
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,067
"My good friend Principal Jones".

147
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,108
Better yet, "My best friend,

148
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:45,317
Principal Barenthal Jones".

149
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,025
- Hey.
- Ah.

150
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,317
Ahh.

151
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,275
With nice big letters,
so I can frame it!

152
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:55,483
Oh!

153
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,983
Make it out to Steven!

154
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,067
Can your dad sign it...

155
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,525
Make it to Lucy.

156
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,525
Come on, please Adam...

157
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:17,983
- Make my day.
- Come on.

158
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:23,900
That is so funny.

159
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,025
Emma?

160
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:27,608
See you.

161
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,650
Ah!

162
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,192
Ow.

163
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,358
Oh, great.

164
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:36,858
Adam?

165
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:40,192
- What are you doing in there?
- Oh... Uh.

166
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:44,400
Just doing research for my paper
on trash recycling.

167
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:48,942
Really? I didn't realize dumpster diving
was your thing.

168
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,567
Oh yeah.

169
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,733
I'm a big time dumpster diver.

170
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:57,733
So, this is a pretty crazy time for you.

171
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,983
I just wanted my dad back.
But now he's so busy,

172
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,650
it's like he isn't back.

173
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,775
It's weird how life seems
to be going great,

174
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,817
then it throws you a curve ball.

175
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,983
Yeah, tell me about it.

176
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:13,775
I assumed my parents
would be together forever,

177
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:16,108
but that sure didn't happen.

178
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,775
Maybe we shouldn't expect much
from others.

179
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:22,150
I just thought things
would finally be normal.

180
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,442
But they're not.

181
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:26,608
Now he's famous,
everybody wants something from him.

182
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,650
Look on the bright side,
people love your dad.

183
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,025
He makes them happy.

184
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,692
Sometimes, I wish he was still a secret.

185
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,108
What is that?

186
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:39,942
We needed a bigger ride
when we added a bear to the family.

187
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:43,858
You're going to take your driver's test
in that thing?

188
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:48,192
- I didn't even think about that.
- Good luck parallel parking.

189
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:52,692
That's a guaranteed fail.
I'll be taking the bus forever.

190
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,817
Taking the bus?

191
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,108
You're driving the bus.

192
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,983
Ding! This is your stop.
See you later.

193
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,067
Hey Emma, I was thinking...

194
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,608
we could go to the movies sometime.

195
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:12,858
Like on a date or whatever.

196
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,983
Argh. I'm pathetic.

197
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,025
Forget third world,
I want fourth world prices.

198
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:28,692
Hold off until I see the contract.

199
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:31,108
What? No, he can't fax it over.

200
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,067
It's not 1983. Fax is dead.

201
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,317
How you doing kid?

202
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,483
Here you go, on the house.

203
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:41,442
Wait, scratch that.
The manufacturer's cost.

204
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:44,817
Oh, wait a minute,
wholesaler's cost. Okay?

205
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,400
What? No, I told you...

206
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:50,317
Want some of this?

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,525
Eat that you identical looking bad guys.

208
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:56,275
Boom, fireball! Ooo.

209
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:01,275
Wait, Bigfoot shoots fireballs?
This game's logic strains credulity.

210
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:05,025
What's going on?
Where'd he come from?

211
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,483
This Bigfoot game stinks.

212
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,608
The raccoon's the weakest character
and has no special moves.

213
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,025
Armor, zero.

214
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:17,525
Magic, zero. Strength, zero.

215
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,233
This is shameful.

216
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:23,233
- Hey, how was your day?
- You don't want to know.

217
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:24,442
What's all this?

218
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:27,275
This stuff showed up
after the TV appearance.

219
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,483
Who's that guy?

220
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,275
He came with the junk.

221
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:34,483
Well, I think you look handsome.

222
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,900
Not on this one.

223
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,942
Yikes.

224
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,733
Bigfoot, you've gotta pull the trigger

225
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:42,775
and sign these contracts now.

226
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,733
Strike while the iron's hot,

227
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:47,400
because you're only hot
until you're not.

228
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:51,400
Sheesh,
this guy is all about the hard sell.

229
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:52,858
Don't let him rush you.

230
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:56,858
Don't sign until they agree
to a line of plush toys based on me.

231
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:59,150
Those would sell like hotcakes.

232
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:02,317
We'll do variants
to shaft the collectors.

233
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,233
We can do "cute and cuddly",
"fierce and fangy".

234
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:08,567
Maybe one of me in repose?

235
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,733
Oh, I don't want this.

236
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,358
Why, the money's not good enough?

237
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:16,775
You drive a hard bargain Bigfoot,
but I respect that.

238
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:20,233
But we'll get you more.
We'll up your percentage.

239
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,192
I mean I don't want to do this.
Period.

240
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:25,733
No "licensing my likeness

241
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:29,442
in all media and methods
of dissemination". Bla bla bla.

242
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:30,442
What?

243
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:33,525
I got to deal with something.
I'll call you back.

244
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:36,567
I don't want to sell junk
with my face on it.

245
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,608
I want to do something meaningful.

246
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:42,983
Meaningful?
I can't take ten percent of meaningful.

247
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,900
And this letter from the non-profit?

248
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,483
Do you have any idea
why they call it a non-profit?

249
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,400
Hey.

250
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:53,275
Because they don't make any profit!

251
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:58,900
Take your junk and get out.

252
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:02,233
These things happen.
I get tempers are hot.

253
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,817
So, just sleep on it.

254
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,942
I can't stand that guy.

255
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,775
This is getting out of hand.

256
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:15,442
You didn't take the money.
What's your deal?

257
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:19,317
Three people and ten animals
live in this small house.

258
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,900
You can always sleep
outside in the rain.

259
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,733
Who me? No way, I love it here.

260
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,108
Thanks guys.

261
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,442
"Dear Doctor Harrison..."

262
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:33,775
Woops.

263
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,400
"We're writing to you from Alaska.

264
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:39,025
The government's authorized X-TRAKT

265
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:42,400
to remove oil
from our largest wildlife preserve.

266
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,483
This is because X-TRAKT
convinced the government

267
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:49,692
that their 'clean oil' process
has zero environmental impact.

268
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:54,192
We think X-TRAKT is lying,
and they're jeopardizing the ecosystem.

269
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:57,817
With your fame,
you could expose what's going on here,

270
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,858
and stop it before it's too late.

271
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:03,233
Signed: Pam and Shamus."

272
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,858
X-TRAKT. These guys are everywhere.

273
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,233
- Do you believe in destiny?
- Here we go again.

274
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,150
This is what I was meant to do.

275
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,817
Use my voice to help people.

276
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,192
I think I should go.

277
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,483
To Alaska? Seriously?

278
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:21,192
I can make a difference there.

279
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:24,233
No way. You just got home,
you can't leave again.

280
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,150
What's the point of fame
if I don't make the world better?

281
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,817
You know what?
I hate to break it to you,

282
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,567
but one person
can't make a difference

283
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,400
all by themselves.

284
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,567
You're wrong. Let me prove it.

285
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,775
And what about me?
We need to talk this over.

286
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,108
For the record,
I would have taken the money.

287
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,983
Adam? Can we talk?

288
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,317
About what?

289
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,775
You're home after all these years
and already want to leave.

290
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:56,692
Have a fun vacation.

291
00:16:56,775 --> 00:17:01,192
You know it's not like that.
I need to do something with my life.

292
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,733
And I need sleep.
I got school tomorrow.

293
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:13,525

Fine. Just never been
in such a little plane before.

00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,608
It's bumpy.

302
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,233
This, this is nothing.

303
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:53,983

Bigfoot here. I just landed
in Rocky Valley, Alaska.

329
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:54,067
I'm here to do what I can
to save this place.

330
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,900
But first thing's first,
I gotta find those who invited me.

331
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:00,983
Look at this place.

332
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,150
The air is so fresh and clean.

333
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,358
And listen to how quiet it is...

334
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:09,150
Yippie!

335
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,942
We'll have to cut that part out.

336
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:19,483
Back in the day,
Rocky Valley used to be a mining town.

337
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:23,192
This old ghost town has been deserted
for over a century.

338
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:26,983
It's good to see
that nature is reclaiming the land.

339
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:32,192
They call it a ghost town,

340
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:36,025
but we all know
there's no such thing as ghosts.

341
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,900
Well, that's creepy.

342
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:43,150
Hello, is someone there?

343
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,900
Okay. There, like that.

344
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,983
Oof.
You got my heart racing there.

345
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:56,650
- I thought you might be a ghost.
- Hey, get off my land!

346
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:57,733
What?

347
00:20:57,817 --> 00:20:59,983
- Buzz off.
- What?

348
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:05,733
Woah!

349
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,067
- Hold on there. Stop.
- You get what that means?

350
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,858
- It means get off my land...
- Woah.

351
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,900
Ah!

352
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:23,900
We'll have to edit that out.

353
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:28,233
Hey ho. Hey ho.
X-TRAKT Oil has got to go.

354
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:32,275
Hey ho. Hey ho.
X-TRAKT Oil has got to go.

355
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,483
Hi there.

356
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,525
Wow, look who's here.

357
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:37,358
Dr. Harrison, hi.

358
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:39,608
I'm Pam, we talked on the phone.

359
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:42,650
Nice to meet you.
Call me Bigfoot, everyone does.

360
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,525
I'm Shamus.
Thank you so much for coming.

361
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:48,150
You've got a cause
worth fighting for.

362
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,525
I couldn't wait to get here.
That said, I expected,

363
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,608
well... more people.

364
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,317
So far, there's only the two of us.

365
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,733
But we're highly motivated.

366
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:01,067
Well, it's a start.

367
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,275
So, where's the oil company?

368
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:06,275
Somewhere on the other side
of that bridge.

369
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,192
Nobody can get close.

370
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:12,483
They got guards patrolling
and drones blocking the airspace.

371
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,150
Nothing shady going on there.

372
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,108
Well I'm here to help amplify
your message.

373
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:21,692
Hey man, I'm Arlo.
Welcome to Rocky Valley.

374
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,983
Arlo grew up in Alaska,

375
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,567
so our cause is close to his heart.

376
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,525
We're camped out over there.

377
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,275
Find yourself a patch of earth,
and throw down your gear.

378
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:36,358
Thanks, I will.
But first, jump over there with the...

379
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,067
the rest of the group.

380
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:44,317
To anybody out there watching,
this is a call to action.

381
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,067
Write to your local representative,
share this video,

382
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,692
or if you're up for an adventure,

383
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:53,733
come join us in Alaska
and make your voice heard.

384

00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,858
14 views.

388
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:09,233
- I'd get more with the lens cap on.
- I feel sorry for him.

389
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:13,858
At that rate, he's not gonna be home
for Christmas. He needs our help.

390
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,442
I thought one man
could make a difference.

391
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,983
- Come on, be a good sport.
- Okay. Okay.

392
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:23,358
We can spice it up.
Let's add music and snappy editing.

393
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:34,358
Drag, drop, throw in the trims bin.

394
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:38,150
Gimme one of them star wipes.

395
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,775
No star wipes.

396
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:43,692
What do you mean no star wipes?
This must look professional.

- Great, I wanna ask you something.

00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:26,275
<i>Oh, tell me?</i>

412
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:31,400
My dad's internet game is super weak,
and he needs all the help he can get.

413
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:36,483
I edited his video, and was wondering
if your soccer team could share it?

414
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:39,983
- <i>Yeah. Uh, I'll text them right now.</i>
- Thanks.

415
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:42,400
- You rock.
- <i>Yep.</i>

416
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:47,817
Hopefully this gets
enough attention for you to come home.

417
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:52,025
That's enough, this is my internet time.

418
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:56,442
Ooo. That's the good stuff right there.

419
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:59,025
Ugh, I can't believe
you look at that trash.

420
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:02,067

The world still needs oil.

453
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:20,317
Back in my father's day,
extracting oil made a heck of a mess.

454
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,942
That's what drove us to invent
X-TRAKT's new Clean Oil technology.

We're more of a tech company now.

00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:49,400
The verdict's in.
Dad has no idea how to use his computer.

519
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:52,400
If you look like a caveman,
your computer skills...

520
00:31:52,483 --> 00:31:53,358
Shh.

521
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:56,983
<i>...as Bigfoot,
leader of oil drilling protesters...</i>

522
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:58,525
- <i>is missing.</i>
- What?

523
00:31:58,608 --> 00:32:01,983
<i>Well I saw him leave
his tent last night.</i>

524
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:05,775
<i>I assumed it was just like
a bathroom trip to the woods.</i>

525
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:09,817
<i>I didn't offer to go with him
because that would be strange.</i>

526
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:15,400
<i>X-TRAKT guys said their security cameras
showed him crossing the bridge.</i>

527
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,608
<i>They went to look for him,
but this is all that was left.</i>

528
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:22,567
<i>Apparently, it was
a pretty gruesome scene.</i>

529
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,608
<i>Looks like Bigfoot was attacked
by wolves.</i>

530
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:28,442
- Attacked by wolves?
- Makes no sense.

531
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:31,067
Dad talks to animals,
they'd leave him be.

532
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,942
Adam's right, this makes no sense.

533
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:36,150
That's just impossible.

534
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,233
Something weird's going on.

535
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:42,150
Maybe the call of the wild was strong,
and he's leaving us.

536
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:44,025
No, not a chance.

537
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:46,733
Adam, he was really happy
to be back home.

538
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:50,858
We need to catch
the next flight to Alaska.

539
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:52,150
Forget flying.

540
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:56,192
If we're going out to the woods,
we need Wilbur as backup.

541
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,775
Let's take the camper.

542
00:32:57,858 --> 00:33:00,442
I'm right here,
and you know I want to go.

543
00:33:00,942 --> 00:33:02,733
Fine. Wilbur and Trapper.

544
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:04,067
Woah, woah. Hold on,

545
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,483
you want us to drive miles
in that musty old camper

546
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,650
with a grizzly bear and a raccoon?

547
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:14,067
I'm not saying it's gonna smell great.
But we'll do it for Dad.

548
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:17,358
Alright, we're packed.

549
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:22,275
<i>♪ Let's get out of town ♪</i>

550
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:27,692
Bye, girls. Take care of your mom.

551
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:30,025
Don't do anything stupid, honey.

552
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,317
- I can't make any promises.
- Hey, Steve...

553
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,025
Make sure you tape my shows!

554
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:38,442
I'll even wait to watch them
with you.

555
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,942
Huh, I ain't waiting.
I'm watching.

556
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,067
What? I gotta know if Brandine wakes up
from her coma

557
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,817
and meets her long lost twin sister.

558
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,858
- I've just got to know.
- Wah.

559
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:56,817
Woah.

560
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,192
Ow.

561
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:02,150
I'll be gone for a bit.
Can you grab my homework?

562
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,983
Thanks. Okay, gotta go.

563
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:06,067
No, you hang up first.

564
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:08,858
- No, you.
- Let me help you.

565
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:09,775
Hey!

566
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:13,358
Oh la la.
Was that your girlfriend?

567
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,608
Shut up,
or you're going on the roof.

568
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:18,733
I apologize. My mouth got ahead of me.

569
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:21,275
- I get rowdy when I travel.
- Buckle up.

570
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:26,150
My seat belt won't fit.

571
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:30,483
Seat belts aren't for animals.
We don't play by human rules.

572
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,983
Watch out.

573
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:39,025
I guess they got those seat belt rules
for a reason.

574
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:49,108
Better play it safe.
Your mom's a reckless driver.

- Uh...

He likes your musical taste.

611

Your father was the same way at first.
Too shy to tell me.

Seesh. He cuts her off just when
the story was starting to get good.

My first ghost town.

632
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,442
Ohh. I'm scared.

633
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,900
There's no ghosts,
it's just the name.

634
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:25,775
No, I'm scared I won't be able to get
a good thin crust pizza out here.

- No, we're just spinning.

If we die out here,
we'd be the ghosts in this ghost town.

00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:38,692
Trapper.

639
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:39,650
What?

640
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:41,692
Ah, give me a break.

641
00:39:41,775 --> 00:39:44,942
We're a thousand miles from a tow truck.

643
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:50,525
Thanks for the ringing endorsement,
glad I could help.

644
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:52,150
Sorry,
that's not what I meant.

645
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,400
Sorry, you scared us.

646
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,608
Me? I don't think I've ever scared
anyone before.

647
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,567
I guess we're all just a little jumpy.

648
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:14,858
You gotta warn somebody
when you got a grizzly

649
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:19,317
- in the back of your camper van.
- That's Wilbur. He's harmless.

650
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:23,442
You're one of the protesters.
We saw you on TV.

651
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:26,983
Hey, the name's Arlo. Arlo Woodstock.

652
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:30,400
Hi, Arlo. I'm looking for my husband,
James Harrison.

653
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:32,858
He's 6'1", brown eyes, great smile...

654
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:37,400
He's also Bigfoot. In the future,
you should probably lead with that.

655
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:41,858
Yes, he's Bigfoot.
I'm still not used to calling him that.

656
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,400
So, where are the other protesters?

657
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:49,150
After what happened to Bigfoot,
they got scared and bugged out.

658
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:51,858
They're lying
about what happened to him.

659
00:40:51,942 --> 00:40:54,775
He's tough,
he can handle himself in the wild.

660
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:59,275
Not sure it'll help you,
but I can take you where I last saw him.

661
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:03,150
I'm going with Arlo.
Adam, stay here with Wilbur.

662
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:07,108
No way. I didn't come to Alaska
just to wait in the car.

663
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:10,608
Let me make sure it's safe,
then I'll come back for you.

664
00:41:10,692 --> 00:41:14,442
Listen to your mom, kid.
You'll be safer here with the bear.

665
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:15,900
Uh, I think.

666
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:18,900
- Mom.
- Adam, this is not up for debate.

667
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:21,400
Lock the door, and only open it for me.

668
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:22,942
Okay.

669
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:27,025
You let anything happen to him,
you're a rug.

670
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:29,442
- A rug? Ooo.
- Ow.

671
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:30,983
Oh, yes, ma'am.

672
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,983
Paper, scissors, stone.

673
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,483
I win.

674
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:49,525
No, I win.
Stone over scissor.

675
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:52,525
What scissor?
This is a clean sheet of paper.

676
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:53,983
Oh, you cheater.

677
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:55,733
Okay, okay, okay.

678
00:41:55,817 --> 00:41:58,317
- How about a game of poker?
- Okay.

679
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:07,525
Sorry Wilbur, 4 two's, I win.

680
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,858
Uh, are you sure?

681
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:12,942
Of course I am sure.
A two is better than a one.

682
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:15,233
Oh, you cheater.

683
00:42:18,692 --> 00:42:21,192
I was a millionaire on paper,

684
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:23,900
but the market tanked
before I sold my shares.

685
00:42:23,983 --> 00:42:26,317
- Unbelievable.
- It's been too long.

686
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Uh-uh.

687
00:42:28,483 --> 00:42:31,025
Can't let you go, I promised your mom.

688
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:33,775
Given our past,
you side with her over me?

689
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:38,983
Absolutely. I'm terrified of your mom.
She might turn me into a rug.

690
00:42:39,317 --> 00:42:42,358
Me too, she's got
that crazy look in her eyes.

691
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:44,025
- Total psycho.
- Shh.

692
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:46,275
There's a noise. Get down.

693
00:42:54,692 --> 00:42:57,900
- Who is it?
- Your mom's friend. Open up.

694
00:42:57,983 --> 00:42:58,858
Her friend?

695
00:42:59,942 --> 00:43:02,108
She doesn't know anybody here.

696
00:43:02,192 --> 00:43:07,067
Sure she does. She told me
to come get you. Hurry up, we gotta go.

697
00:43:08,025 --> 00:43:10,400
Ugh, we ain't got time for this.

698
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:14,442
Woah.

699
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:21,817
Ahh.

700
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,067
Oh, oh boy.

701
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:29,400
Show's over.
You're coming with us.

702
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,650
- Woah.
- Adam.

703
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:32,692
Get him.

704
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:34,900
Run! Get out of here.

705
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:45,858
Ahh. Ow.

706
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:50,067
Ow.

707
00:43:57,858 --> 00:43:59,692
Go, go. Nail him.

708
00:44:01,983 --> 00:44:02,817
Woah.

709
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:10,733
What the...?

710
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,192
Alright, over here.

711
00:44:18,275 --> 00:44:19,983
You're gonna get it.

712
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:29,692
Ahh.

713
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,233
He is running away.
Come on, let's go.

714
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:43,942
Ah.

715
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:45,900
Oh!

716
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:01,108
Ahh!

717
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:04,733
Woah, he jumped.

718
00:45:05,817 --> 00:45:08,650
There's no way he survived that.

719
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,442
We're done here.

720
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:24,567
Ah!

721
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,108
That figures, no signal.

722
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:07,983
Ahh!

723
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:11,567
Get off me.

724
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,650
Humans don't belong here.

725
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:20,358
- Go home.
- Ah.

726
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:21,900
I'm here to find my dad.

727
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:25,108
You... you can understand me?

728
00:46:25,192 --> 00:46:27,650
Yes, I can talk to animals.

729
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:29,942
I'm not here to hurt you, trust me.

730
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:31,442
Ah... Ow.

731
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:35,358
No human is to be trusted.

732
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:41,108
You destroy our land
and poison the ground we walk on.

733
00:46:41,192 --> 00:46:44,733
All you care about
is the black smelly water.

734
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:47,650
That's not true.
My dad came here

735
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:51,067
to stop the oil company,
but then he disappeared.

736
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,483
Maybe you're going to disappear too.

737
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:57,192
Not all humans are bad.

738
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:58,900
If you help me find my dad,

739
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,775
I promise we'll protect your valley.

740
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:05,858
Why should I believe you?

741
00:47:05,942 --> 00:47:08,817
Either I'm being honest,
and we can help each other,

742
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:12,733
or I'm lying and you can eat me.

743
00:47:13,317 --> 00:47:14,483
Hmm.

744
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:17,400
Not much meat on those bones.

745
00:47:17,483 --> 00:47:19,942
Well, it's what I've got to offer.

746
00:47:20,025 --> 00:47:23,775
Plus, I don't plan on getting eaten.
I'm telling the truth.

747
00:47:24,192 --> 00:47:26,442
I don't know where your father is.

748
00:47:26,942 --> 00:47:30,317
But I can show you
where to start looking.

749
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,567
Huh?

750
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:37,608
Ouch.

751
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:41,067
Come on, big galoot, get up.

752
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,233
You can't handle one lousy dart?

753
00:47:45,192 --> 00:47:47,108
Oh. That'd do it.

754
00:47:47,192 --> 00:47:48,192
Ugh.

755
00:47:56,733 --> 00:48:00,275
Alright, we're stranded out here
and we're all on our own.

756
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:02,567
We gotta take stock of our supplies.

757
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,775
Oh.

758
00:48:08,692 --> 00:48:12,067
Phew. Okay big guy,
I know you like to eat,

759
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,233
but we need to ration our food.

760
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:17,192
<i>♪ Hallelujah ♪</i>

761
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:19,567
Of course, we don't wanna get so weak

762
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,525
that we're defenseless.
And you're out cold.

763
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,358
I gotta keep my strength up.

764
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,775
This is to protect you.

765
00:48:27,858 --> 00:48:31,233
I won't enjoy
this double fudge caramel wafer.

766
00:48:33,192 --> 00:48:35,817
Oh man that's good.

767
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:38,358
It also brings me...

768
00:48:38,442 --> 00:48:41,192
no joy to eat this entire...

769
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:42,692
bag of marshmallows.

770
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:47,525
Mmm. Oh, that's good.

771
00:48:50,442 --> 00:48:53,358
Keep up. Not much further now.

772
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:55,275
You said that two hours ago.

773
00:48:56,983 --> 00:48:59,400
Ugh. I'm dying for something to eat.

774
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:02,942
And I'd like to eat something
that's dying.

775
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:04,817
Good one.

776
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,233
Play on words.

777
00:49:09,192 --> 00:49:10,608
Hey, where are you going?

778
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:13,483
- Huh?
- Oh. Wolf. Run!

779
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:17,858
Woah, stop. What are you doing?

780
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,650
- What's your deal?
- You know this maniac?

781
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:23,650
- Are you two in cahoots?
- It's not like that.

782
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:28,483
I get how this works.
You lure me out, he eats me!

783
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:32,233
- Go on, I'll stop him.
- Don't put me down, are you nuts?

784
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:34,233
- No.
- Stop.

785
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:36,775
I said stop.

786
00:49:36,858 --> 00:49:38,567
Woah... Oof.

787
00:49:41,983 --> 00:49:43,358
What is wrong with you?

788
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:47,442
Ah, it's instinct,
I couldn't help myself.

789
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:50,858
If you were a vegetarian,
it would be a lot easier

790
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:53,233
for you to make friends... Oh.

791
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:58,192
Does the phrase "lone wolf" ring a bell?

792
00:49:58,275 --> 00:50:01,400
I'm not here to make friends.

793
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:05,775
Now come on, it's just over that ridge.

794
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:08,150
Okay... let's go.

795
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:42,150
Ah!

796
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:03,108
Jeez.

797
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,400
So much for clean oil,
leaving no impact.

798
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:18,817
Get down.

799
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,650
Robot bird.

800
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:42,025
I'll bet you my dad's down there.

801
00:51:42,108 --> 00:51:43,192
Let's go.

802
00:51:44,817 --> 00:51:47,108
- Come on.
- This is far as I go.

803
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:48,025
What?

804
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,900
I will not walk on poisoned land.

805
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,983
Uh, you're just gonna leave me?

806
00:51:53,483 --> 00:51:56,692
I kept my promise by bringing you here.

807
00:51:57,067 --> 00:52:01,275
Now you keep yours, and save our valley.

808
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:04,442
Hmm.

809
00:52:24,483 --> 00:52:27,692
As soon as we finish in Alaska,
we'd be delighted

810
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,775
to bring our clean oil process
to your town.

811
00:52:34,275 --> 00:52:36,317
Yes, yes, that sounds perfect.

812
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,150
Man I hate drilling in Alaska,

813
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:40,442
it's way too cold.

814
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:43,567
I hear ya.
I wish we were still drilling in Texas.

815
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:46,608
Nah, I hate Texas, too.
It's way too hot.

816
00:52:46,692 --> 00:52:48,858
You're difficult to please, Roy.

817
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,317
<i>X-TRAKT puts nature first.</i>

818
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,067
<i>Just look around,
we're taking care of the environment.</i>

819
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:04,817
<i>Clean oil by X-TRAKT,</i>

820
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
<i>for a cleaner tomorrow.</i>

821
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:26,525
Ah.

822
00:53:26,608 --> 00:53:30,317
Perfect. We'll talk to you soon.
Bye now.

823
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:36,358
Can you believe that?
Clean oil extraction.

824
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:38,108
Everybody is so gullible.

825
00:53:38,192 --> 00:53:42,233
Ain't that right, Grandpa?
We Mandrakes can sell snow to an eskimo.

826
00:53:43,025 --> 00:53:45,442
All you gotta do is look the part.

827
00:53:45,525 --> 00:53:48,817
First you got your sparkly ring.

828
00:53:49,275 --> 00:53:51,025
And your 10 gallon Stetson.

829
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,942
Let's not forget

830
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,192
the old big belt buckle.

831
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,442
That's it.

832
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:57,733
Pew, pew.

833
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:01,025
Ah, looking good.

834
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,692
Yes?

835
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:07,942
What? Give me one minute.
I'm on my way.

836
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,942
Dang it, what's the holdup?

837
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:14,942
Mr. Mandrake,

838
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:19,650
drilling through the frozen ground
is taking longer than we anticipated.

839
00:54:19,733 --> 00:54:22,775
You eggheads didn't think
Alaska would be cold?

840
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:27,400
We have our IPO at the end of the month,
and I need results now.

841
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:30,358
But sir, there's also been
some concern raised

842
00:54:30,442 --> 00:54:33,275
about the BD-416 impact charge.

843
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:36,733
The BD-416? That's a terrible name.

844
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:41,067
Doesn't have a ring to it.
From now on we call that bomb...

845
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,442
the "Big Daddy".

846
00:54:43,525 --> 00:54:46,317
Yes sir. So, the bad news is:

847
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,567
The shockwave from the "Big...

848
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,442
The "Big Daddy"
that will fracture the bedrock,

849
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:54,608
and will force a lot of oil
to the surface.

850
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:57,150
The level will be higher
than anticipated,

851
00:54:57,233 --> 00:54:59,150
flooding the entire valley.

852
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,233
Cool! Maximum impact for maximum oil.
That's not bad news.

853
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:07,025
What about
the larger environmental impact?

854
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:10,192
Pfft. With Bigfoot
and his hippie followers gone,

855
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:11,317
who's watching?

856
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,858
But of course, with heavy hearts,
we'll issue the standard apology.

857
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:17,025
Wow.

858
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:29,442
Psst. Hey, kid. Down here.

859
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:30,358
Arlo?

860
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:34,817
Dude, don't go that way,
there's guards waiting for you up there.

861
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,983
There's another way out.
Follow me. Hurry.

862
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:40,942
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, your mom.

863
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,483
She sent me to get you.

864
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:44,275
She's worried sick dude.

865
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:46,567
- Is she okay?
- She's fine, man.

866
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,817
Hold this for a second, will you?

867
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:53,108
Yeah and let's make it nice
and tight and comfortable for you.

868
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:55,400
What are you doing?

869
00:55:55,483 --> 00:55:58,900
You hippies are so trusting,
it's pathetic.

870
00:55:58,983 --> 00:56:02,358
It's why we always bring you down
from the inside, punk.

871
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,608
- I thought you were one of us.
- Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,

872
00:56:06,692 --> 00:56:09,692
dude, yeah whatever.
I'm a hired gun.

873
00:56:09,775 --> 00:56:13,108
I follow the money,
and there's always money in big oil.

874
00:56:16,192 --> 00:56:18,858
Tell the boss I'm coming in
with the intruder.

875
00:56:29,817 --> 00:56:32,358
Don't even try it, kid.

876
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:36,692
Ugh.

877
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:39,775
What happened?

878
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,150
Ohh.

879
00:56:41,483 --> 00:56:44,150
Those X-TRAKT goons shot us with darts,

880
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:47,108
put us in the trailer,
and then into a ditch.

881
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:48,817
You know what's worse?

882
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,108
They took all our food.

883
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:54,650
Every single last piece.

884
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:55,567
Mmm.

885
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,108
Then they came back
and left us the trash.

886
00:56:58,192 --> 00:56:59,692
That's terrible.

887
00:57:00,858 --> 00:57:02,442
Where's Adam?

888
00:57:02,525 --> 00:57:04,483
He and his big feet
out-ran them.

889
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:06,025
We've gotta go after him.

890
00:57:06,317 --> 00:57:08,775
How can we do that?
We're stuck in a ditch.

891
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,483
It's okay.

892
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:11,483
I'll push.

893
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:13,650
You think you can drive this thing?

894
00:57:13,733 --> 00:57:16,108
Yeah, what kind of questions is that?

895
00:57:16,192 --> 00:57:19,400
I'm a raccoon.
Of course I can drive this thing.

896
00:57:28,108 --> 00:57:29,067
Ugh.

897
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:36,733
Thanks for the help.

898
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:39,192
Yeah.

899
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:42,192
Get off my land.
Get out of here.

900
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:44,775
Buzz off.

901
00:57:45,483 --> 00:57:46,608
Grr.

902
00:57:47,733 --> 00:57:50,483
- Wait.
- Get off my land.

903
00:57:52,442 --> 00:57:53,358
Wait.

904
00:57:54,525 --> 00:57:55,817
Hold on.

905
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,233
- Bailed out by a moose.
- Woah.

906
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:03,442
That won't look good on your resume.

907
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:05,983
Come on lazy bones, quit sitting around.

908
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,650
We gotta find Adam.

909
00:58:07,733 --> 00:58:11,567
Move over NASCAR,
there's a new champ in town.

910
00:58:17,192 --> 00:58:18,067
Ahh.

911
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:20,192
Woah!

912
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:24,150
Out of the way, knuckleheads!

913
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:27,775
I only got one rock,
and it lives on the gas pedal.

914
00:58:27,858 --> 00:58:30,108
You're doing great,
you're a natural.

915
00:58:34,317 --> 00:58:37,067
We have a perimeter breach
on the bridge. Woah.

916
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,025
I repeat,

917
00:58:38,692 --> 00:58:41,900
<i>a perimeter breach.
They're in a camper van.</i>

918
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:44,150
Woah, woah. Did you say camper van?

919
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,108
Hey Wilbur,
can you read English?

920
00:58:58,192 --> 00:59:01,400
- No, why?
- There's a bunch of signs flying by.

921
00:59:01,483 --> 00:59:02,900
Probably just ads.

922
00:59:02,983 --> 00:59:05,483
Too bad, suckers, I can't read.

923
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:07,233
You ain't getting my money.

924
00:59:11,942 --> 00:59:14,150
In case this is it,

925
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:16,400
I gotta tell you something.

926
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:18,275
I love you too, Trapper.

927
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:19,650
Not that.

928
00:59:19,733 --> 00:59:23,775
You know how I told you
the X-TRAKT guys took all our food?

929
00:59:23,858 --> 00:59:25,858
- Yeah.
- Well, I... Ahh!

930
00:59:33,108 --> 00:59:34,525
- You okay?
- Uh...

931
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:39,192
What were you going to say about
those X-TRAKT guys taking our food?

932
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:41,817
Uh. I was gonna say...

933
00:59:42,275 --> 00:59:44,567
It's just so unfair.

934
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,483
How could they?
That's all.

935
00:59:49,192 --> 00:59:51,233
Grr.

936
00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:57,942
You know, you're trespassing.

937
00:59:58,025 --> 01:00:01,067
- I could have you arrested.
- Great idea.

938
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:02,358
Let's call the cops.

939
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,608
Up here, we prefer
to handle security ourselves.

940
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:11,400
Is it worth destroying
this place for oil?

941
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,650
Absolutely.

942
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:17,525
You think I give a hoot
about this "high tech" clean energy?

943
01:00:17,608 --> 01:00:21,317
Not a chance. I'm an oil man.

944
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,483
My daddy was an oil man,
my daddy's daddy was an oil man.

945
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:28,192
Oil's not going away on my watch.

946
01:00:28,775 --> 01:00:31,567
With this new extraction method,
oil's about

947
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:34,150
to get a lot more profitable.

948
01:00:34,608 --> 01:00:36,983
What did you do with my parents?

949
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:39,442
Tell you what, I'm make you a deal.

950
01:00:39,525 --> 01:00:43,983
If you don't tell anyone what you saw,
I'll take you to them.

951
01:00:44,067 --> 01:00:47,275
Whatever it takes,
I just want my family back.

952
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:48,442
Wise choice.

953
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:52,025
After all,
family is the most important thing.

954
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:55,400
Well then, allow me to reunite you.

955
01:00:57,275 --> 01:00:58,942
They're down there somewhere.

956
01:01:20,233 --> 01:01:22,275
Break, you piece of junk.

957
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,900
This is Adam Harrison.
I'm underground with no signal.

958
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:37,525
This phone has enough evidence on it
to bring down X-TRAKT.

959
01:01:37,608 --> 01:01:40,108
Whoever finds this,
post these videos

960
01:01:40,192 --> 01:01:43,150
and expose these people
for who they really are.

961
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:46,275
Mom and Dad, if you see this,

962
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:48,192
there's some stuff I wanna say.

963
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:52,400
Dad, I'm sorry for getting mad at you
for coming to Alaska.

964
01:01:52,483 --> 01:01:55,400
You were right,
this place is worth saving.

965
01:01:55,483 --> 01:02:00,108
And Mom, I love you and I want you know
how much I appreciate everything.

966
01:02:00,692 --> 01:02:02,942
Well, except your meatloaf.

967
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:05,900
And finally, Emma.

968
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:07,817
It turns out, life is short.

969
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,567
I wish I would've told you
how I felt.

970
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,900
To be honest,
I'm going to miss you so much.

971
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,608
Grr.

972
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:29,608
Woah.

973
01:02:48,108 --> 01:02:49,108
Ahh.

974
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,525
Mom, look! It's me.

975
01:02:55,942 --> 01:02:59,442
Adam! I've been so worried about you.

976
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,567
Are you okay?

977
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,317
Easy Mom, it hurts.

978
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,942
Let me get those off you.

979
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,400
Woah, woah.
Careful with that thing.

980
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,608
Stay still.

981
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:13,608
Thanks. Have you seen dad?

982
01:03:13,983 --> 01:03:15,775
He's got to be down here too.

983
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:19,817
The tunnels go on forever.
I don't know how to find him.

984
01:03:20,108 --> 01:03:24,275
Dad's got great hearing.
If we make enough noise, he'll hear us.

985
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:26,817
- Dad!
- Jim!

986
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,900
- Dad!
- Jim!

987
01:03:29,483 --> 01:03:31,442
- Jim!
- Dad!

988
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,900
Ahh.

989
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:39,817
Ahh.

990
01:03:46,233 --> 01:03:47,067
Dad?

991
01:03:47,525 --> 01:03:49,317
It's him. I can hear him.

992
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,608
Are you sure?

993
01:03:50,692 --> 01:03:52,858
Yeah,
it's coming from this way.

994
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:58,775
Ahh.

995
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:00,483
Definitely broken.

996
01:04:02,483 --> 01:04:04,192
Come on. Come on.

997
01:04:10,108 --> 01:04:11,858
He's here! Hey, Dad.

998
01:04:11,942 --> 01:04:14,067
Hey buddy. I'm so happy to see you.

999
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,525
I was so worried,
I thought I'd never see you again.

1000
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:19,858
I knew I could count on you.

1001
01:04:19,942 --> 01:04:22,608
I was naive to think
I could do this alone.

1002
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,567
Forget that.
Let's finish this thing, together.

1003
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:26,900
We've got to leave.

1004
01:04:26,983 --> 01:04:29,317
X-TRAKT is gonna blow up
this place,

1005
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,733
and I'd rather not be down here for it.

1006
01:04:31,817 --> 01:04:33,192
I can't go anywhere.

1007
01:04:33,275 --> 01:04:34,900
My foot is broken.

1008
01:04:34,983 --> 01:04:36,400
Okay, I'm on it.

1009
01:04:53,317 --> 01:04:54,525
Thank you.

1010
01:04:54,608 --> 01:04:57,650
Hey, we're a family,
and we stick together.

1011
01:04:58,358 --> 01:05:00,192
Now let's get out of here.

1012
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,692
Sir, we've just hit target depth.

1013
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:07,775
Finally.

1014
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:10,608
Now prepare the "Big Daddy".

1015
01:05:10,692 --> 01:05:12,900
<i>Prepare the BD-416.</i>

1016
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:16,608
<i>Ouch.
I mean prepare the Big Daddy.</i>

1017
01:05:36,775 --> 01:05:38,733
Hold on. Do you hear that?

1018
01:05:38,817 --> 01:05:41,108
- Yeah.
- Uh, no.

1019
01:05:41,192 --> 01:05:43,108
It's coming from over there.

1020
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,775
That's the bomb.

1021
01:05:57,942 --> 01:06:01,192
If that thing blows,
this entire mine will collapse.

1022
01:06:01,275 --> 01:06:02,692
We've gotta disarm it.

1023
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:11,400
- They don't look friendly.
- I doubt they saw us.

1024
01:06:11,483 --> 01:06:13,025
Shh.

1025
01:06:14,983 --> 01:06:17,692
Sir, there's something you have to see.

1026
01:06:17,775 --> 01:06:18,608
Look.

1027
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:22,400
They're not gonna compromise this.

1028
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:24,983
Make sure they don't get out alive.

1029
01:06:25,067 --> 01:06:30,150
Uh, sir, just to clarify the air here,
and please do not take offense.

1030
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:34,317
Umm. Are you asking me to kill them?

1031
01:06:34,733 --> 01:06:37,817
Because that's not really
in my job description.

1032
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:41,442
Give me that job description.
Arlo, get over here.

1033
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:43,817
I thought you'd never ask.

1034
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,650
- Move over, pal.
- Hey!

1035
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:49,567
Time to see
what these drone babies can do!

1036
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,150
Uh-oh, run!

1037
01:07:06,483 --> 01:07:09,400
I was wrong,
they definitely noticed us.

1038
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:11,900
- Really?
- No sassing.

1039
01:07:11,983 --> 01:07:13,108
Ahh. Oof.

1040
01:07:14,233 --> 01:07:15,233
- Over here.
- Woah.

1041
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:21,192
Oof.

1042
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,983
This is too old.

1043
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,025
Dad, the drone's cutting the cables.

1044
01:07:38,483 --> 01:07:39,692
Oh no.

1045
01:07:45,483 --> 01:07:47,358
Phew. That worked out well.

1046
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:54,150
Ugh.

1047
01:07:54,817 --> 01:07:56,400
I hate roller coasters.

1048
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:03,733
- Let's take a ride.
- Okay, let's go.

1049
01:08:04,775 --> 01:08:09,692
As long as the tunnels haven't caved in,
this thing has got to lead somewhere.

1050
01:08:19,317 --> 01:08:20,275
Uh-oh.

1051
01:08:20,358 --> 01:08:22,442
It's following us.
Pump really fast.

1052
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,400
Ahh. Woah.

1053
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:33,650
Should we slow down?
This isn't feeling that safe.

1054
01:08:33,733 --> 01:08:35,983
We're trapped in an abandoned mine,

1055
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:39,817
and psychopaths with crazy drones
are trying to kill us!

1056
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,358
Let's see how they deal
with this drone!

1057
01:08:47,692 --> 01:08:48,983
Grr.

1058
01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:56,317
Damn! Drone down.
I lost one of my babies.

1059
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,775
Technically, they're my babies.
I pay for them.

1060
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:14,567
- Woah.
- Adam.

1061
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:17,608
Ahh.

1062
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:37,983
- Gotcha.
- Ahh.

1063
01:09:41,983 --> 01:09:42,983
Oh no!

1064
01:09:43,067 --> 01:09:44,525
- Hey!
- Dad.

1065
01:09:44,608 --> 01:09:45,608
Over here.

1066
01:09:49,275 --> 01:09:52,025
- Oh... Jim.
- Watch out.

1067
01:10:03,275 --> 01:10:05,483
- Dad!
- Adam!

1068
01:10:06,108 --> 01:10:06,983
Alright.

1069
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:13,983
There's more.

1070
01:10:14,067 --> 01:10:15,483
Oh no.

1071
01:10:29,317 --> 01:10:30,150
Ahh.

1072
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,900
Ohh.
Okay, we're safe.

1073
01:10:47,733 --> 01:10:50,108
They just took out our last drone.

1074
01:10:52,608 --> 01:10:55,025
There's no escaping the "Big Daddy".

1075
01:10:55,108 --> 01:10:58,192
It's not scheduled to detonate
for another day.

1076
01:10:58,275 --> 01:11:00,150
We must clear
our machines and...

1077
01:11:00,233 --> 01:11:02,775
Change of plans.
Y'all got 10 minutes.

1078
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,275
Oh, this is insane.

1079
01:11:04,358 --> 01:11:07,275
Anything left in this valley
will be drowned

1080
01:11:07,358 --> 01:11:10,400
in a beautiful ocean of oil.

1081
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:12,317
All teams evacuate now.

1082
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,608
<i>Ten minutes until detonation.
All personnel evacuate now.</i>

1083
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,525
<i>Ten minutes until detonation.</i>

1084
01:11:27,692 --> 01:11:30,108
The explosions set the oil on fire.

1085
01:11:30,192 --> 01:11:31,817
Uh guys...

1086
01:11:32,817 --> 01:11:34,025
We have to jump it.

1087
01:11:34,108 --> 01:11:36,025
We need speed. Hang on!

1088
01:11:43,358 --> 01:11:45,025
Don't breathe in.

1089
01:11:45,108 --> 01:11:46,775
That smoke is toxic.

1090
01:11:47,358 --> 01:11:49,983
Daylight! We're going to make it.

1091
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:56,567
Phew.

1092
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,150
Finally, fresh air.

1093
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,608
Oh, I'm back online.

1094
01:12:02,692 --> 01:12:05,817
Let's see what the world thinks
of X-TRAKT's plans!

1095
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:08,233
Come on, come on.

1096
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:10,067
Dial-up was faster than this.

1097
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,400
Oh no!

1098
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,400
Now isn't the time
to be posting selfies.

1099
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:20,900
I'm kind of doing
something here.

1100
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:21,858
Slow down.

1101
01:12:21,942 --> 01:12:23,442
I'm trying.

1102
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:25,442
You need to pull harder.

1103
01:12:27,483 --> 01:12:28,317
Hm.

1104
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,900
Good job, honey.

1105
01:12:32,192 --> 01:12:34,233
A river. We must jump.

1106
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,442
- I can't.
- Yeah.

1107
01:12:36,525 --> 01:12:38,275
Don't get wet.
Ahh!

1108
01:12:57,983 --> 01:13:00,067
- Dad!
- Adam!

1109
01:13:10,275 --> 01:13:11,400
Where's your mother?

1110
01:13:11,483 --> 01:13:12,942
Help!

1111
01:13:14,358 --> 01:13:15,525
Shelly!

1112
01:13:15,608 --> 01:13:16,733
Ahh.

1113
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,733
- Waterfall!
- Oh no!

1114
01:13:37,192 --> 01:13:38,900
Mom! Dad!

1115
01:13:45,775 --> 01:13:46,775
Are you okay?

1116
01:13:46,858 --> 01:13:48,483
Yes, we're fine!

1117
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:49,817
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

1118
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:52,650
<i>Time to detonation:
1 minute, 30 seconds.</i>

1119
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:56,150
Get out of the valley fast!
Get to higher ground.

1120
01:13:56,233 --> 01:13:57,650
But what about you?

1121
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,275
Everything is going to be okay, go now!

1122
01:14:00,358 --> 01:14:04,025
<i>Time to detonation,
1 minute, 15 seconds.</i>

1123
01:14:17,525 --> 01:14:19,567
<i>Sixty seconds to detonation.</i>

1124
01:14:21,442 --> 01:14:23,358
There's little time.
We must move.

1125
01:14:23,442 --> 01:14:25,150
I hope Adam made it to safety.

1126
01:14:25,233 --> 01:14:26,525
I'm sure he is fine.

1127
01:14:29,817 --> 01:14:31,483
<i>Thirty seconds to detonation.</i>

1128
01:14:33,942 --> 01:14:35,692
- Adam!
- Oh no.

1129
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:38,483
Ugh.

1130
01:14:40,317 --> 01:14:42,608
Okay, how do I get down there?

1131
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,442
<i>Fifteen seconds to detonation.</i>

1132
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:48,983
I hope this works!

1133
01:14:49,525 --> 01:14:50,733
Woah!

1134
01:14:55,608 --> 01:14:57,650
<i>10, 9...</i>

1135
01:14:57,733 --> 01:15:01,483
- Woah.
- <i>8, 7, 6...</i>

1136
01:15:01,567 --> 01:15:03,733
- Woah!
- <i>5, 4...</i>

1137
01:15:03,817 --> 01:15:04,733
Come on.

1138
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:06,567
- <i>3...</i>
- Come on.

1139
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:07,483
<i>2...</i>

1140
01:15:08,108 --> 01:15:09,275
<i>1...</i>

1141
01:15:14,483 --> 01:15:16,358
- What's going on?
- <i>Disarmed.</i>

1142
01:15:16,817 --> 01:15:18,900
<i>Disarmed. Disarmed.</i>

1143
01:15:18,983 --> 01:15:20,608
He did it!

1144
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:27,692
Woah, man.

1145
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:30,150
No! That's not possible.

1146
01:15:30,608 --> 01:15:33,317
What are you waiting for?

1147
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,067
Start it up again.

1148
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:36,650
It's not that simple, sir.

1149
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:38,525
If it's shut off at the source,

1150
01:15:38,608 --> 01:15:41,900
the only way to detonate it
is another detonation.

1151
01:15:41,983 --> 01:15:45,025
Can't we use
a small fracking bomb for this?

1152
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:48,442
Yes, I suppose that would have
enough explosive charge

1153
01:15:48,525 --> 01:15:50,525
to trigger the BD-416...

1154
01:15:51,067 --> 01:15:54,108
Uh, I mean, the "Big Daddy".

1155
01:15:54,192 --> 01:15:56,442
Arlo, can you handle that device?

1156
01:15:56,525 --> 01:15:57,483
Sure thing.

1157
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:01,733
I used one to blow my old foster home
when I was a kid. It works.

1158
01:16:01,817 --> 01:16:04,025
Great. Let's go then.

1159
01:16:04,775 --> 01:16:05,733
Ouch.

1160
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:07,900
I need a break!

1161
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,608
- Huh?
- Oh, what now?

1162
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,525
- They got another bomb.
- No!

1163
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:24,817
Listen up.

1164
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,483
After tossing the bomb,
get back up the cliff

1165
01:16:27,567 --> 01:16:29,192
before oil floods the valley.

1166
01:16:29,275 --> 01:16:30,442
How long do we have?

1167
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:33,733
Have you ever run
to bathroom in a hurry? Yeah,

1168
01:16:34,108 --> 01:16:35,358
that fast.

1169
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,025
And the hero rode in
on his mighty steed!

1170
01:16:42,317 --> 01:16:43,858
Look! We gotta stop them.

1171
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,358
Step on it.

1172
01:16:45,442 --> 01:16:48,067
It's already stepped on.
This could help.

1173
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,775
We're coming, Adam.

1174
01:17:02,858 --> 01:17:04,733
What kind of circus is this?

1175
01:17:04,817 --> 01:17:05,983
Oh, never mind,

1176
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:08,025
the bear, he's harmless.

1177
01:17:08,108 --> 01:17:10,150
Hey, back off!

1178
01:17:10,233 --> 01:17:12,650
Lean back. I'll deal with him.

1179
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:14,233
Wilbur, watch out.

1180
01:17:14,317 --> 01:17:15,900
- Ow. Ouch.
- Trapper!

1181
01:17:15,983 --> 01:17:18,692
No, not again.

1182
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:23,025
Hang on, Wilbur.

1183
01:17:28,358 --> 01:17:31,942
Give it to them, Wilbur.
Don't worry about me.

1184
01:17:32,025 --> 01:17:34,233
I'm a goner anyway.

1185
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,567
No!

1186
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,525
Hi-ya.

1187
01:17:55,983 --> 01:17:57,317
Well, well, well.

1188
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:02,358
Look who's here.
Mister Big Fool himself.

1189
01:18:02,442 --> 01:18:04,983
Long time no see. Now, give it to me.

1190
01:18:05,067 --> 01:18:06,567
- Never.
- Ha.

1191
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:09,692
- You'd rather blow us all up?
- This ends now.

1192
01:18:09,775 --> 01:18:10,858
You see?

1193
01:18:10,942 --> 01:18:14,025
That's why you hippies will never win.

1194
01:18:14,108 --> 01:18:18,567
There's no room for dreamers out here.
Your type...

1195
01:18:21,608 --> 01:18:24,317
Get off my land. Get out of here.

1196
01:18:26,692 --> 01:18:30,108
The light's still flashing.
Shouldn't you turn that off?

1197
01:18:31,192 --> 01:18:33,483
Oh. Shoot, I can't stop it.

1198
01:18:34,025 --> 01:18:35,108
Plan B!

1199
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:50,650
It was close
but you did good, son.

1200
01:18:50,733 --> 01:18:53,567
Huh. Too close for comfort,
that's for sure.

1201
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,317
Don't you ever do that again.

1202
01:18:56,108 --> 01:18:58,483
You're safe, I'm so proud of you.

1203
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,400
Huh? Guys, what happened?

1204
01:19:00,483 --> 01:19:04,317
- You wrecked the camper.
- Uh-uh... It's not my fault.

1205
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,608
Trapper? Where's Trapper?

1206
01:19:06,692 --> 01:19:09,108
I'm right here.

1207
01:19:11,067 --> 01:19:12,942
<i>This is Channel Six News.</i>

1208
01:19:13,025 --> 01:19:15,275
<i>We'd like to ask you some questions.</i>

1209
01:19:15,358 --> 01:19:18,108
It worked, they saw my videos.

1210
01:19:18,192 --> 01:19:21,525
Hey Mandrake, smile. You're on camera.

1211
01:19:21,983 --> 01:19:25,025
Why are they up there?
This is restricted airspace!

1212
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:26,817
To show people
what you did.

1213
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,775
So you know, I uploaded the video

1214
01:19:28,858 --> 01:19:31,108
of you talking
about destroying here.

1215
01:19:31,192 --> 01:19:34,358
Pfft, we'll say it's fake news,
deny the whole thing.

1216
01:19:34,442 --> 01:19:37,358
As they say:
The truth will set you free.

1217
01:19:37,442 --> 01:19:39,983
Not in your case.
You're going to jail.

1218
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:41,900
Hey look, the cops.

1219
01:19:41,983 --> 01:19:42,900
Uh-oh!

1220
01:19:46,817 --> 01:19:48,900
Catch me if you can.

1221
01:19:49,233 --> 01:19:50,733
What? Ah!

1222
01:19:53,692 --> 01:19:56,400
<i>♪ Do we know
where the light is the brightest? ♪</i>

1223
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:02,983
<i>♪ Do we know how to clear
what the fear is? ♪</i>

1224
01:20:03,067 --> 01:20:04,775
Get off my land.

1225
01:20:04,858 --> 01:20:06,192
Buzz off.

1226
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:12,775
You understand what that means?

1227
01:20:12,858 --> 01:20:17,483
It means get... off... my... land.

1228
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,192
Go for it. Dinner time.

1229
01:20:42,275 --> 01:20:47,067
I don't like human flesh.
But a fresh snow rabbit...

1230
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:49,275
Here we go again.

1231
01:20:57,608 --> 01:21:01,150
<i>I'm Becky Dabmore,
and you're watching</i> Good Morning World.

1232
01:21:01,567 --> 01:21:04,317
<i>I'm here on location in Alaska,
where Bigfoot</i>

1233
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,525
<i>and his family have saved Rocky Valley</i>

1234
01:21:07,608 --> 01:21:10,317
<i>from an environmental disaster.</i>

1235
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,858
<i>So Dr. Harrison,</i>

1236
01:21:11,942 --> 01:21:15,275
it looks like you found a way
to make the world better.

1237
01:21:15,358 --> 01:21:18,108
Thanks Becky,
but I didn't save this place.

1238
01:21:18,192 --> 01:21:19,733
It was my son, Adam.

1239
01:21:19,817 --> 01:21:22,775
And what about you, Adam,
what do you have to say?

1240
01:21:22,858 --> 01:21:26,858
My Dad was right,
one person really can make a difference.

1241
01:21:26,942 --> 01:21:29,733
The government is working
to protect this land.

1242
01:21:29,817 --> 01:21:31,692
Nobody can ever
drill here again.

1243
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:34,025
Mom, you must be so proud?

1244
01:21:34,692 --> 01:21:37,817
I am. I'm proud of the whole family.

1245
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,942
Woah! Ahh!

1246
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,942
I'm okay.

1247
01:21:42,025 --> 01:21:43,692
Oh boy.

1248
01:21:43,775 --> 01:21:46,150
So, I grab the oil company CEO,

1249
01:21:46,233 --> 01:21:49,317
and I look him
in his beady little eyes, and I say,

1250
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,442
"It's time to end this crude behavior."

1251
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:56,525
Get it? Cause sometimes unrefined oil
is called crude.

1252
01:21:58,733 --> 01:22:01,817
I've got to tell you.
I don't think it's funny.

1253
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:06,192
The point is, I saved the day,
and am also the hero of this story.

1254
01:22:07,442 --> 01:22:11,358
Fine. Wilbur helped too.
And Adam I guess.

1255
01:22:12,275 --> 01:22:13,900
But it was mostly me.

1256
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:18,192
Oh, whoops. Sorry, bad toss.

1257
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:21,358
Normally I'd be upset.

1258
01:22:21,442 --> 01:22:23,900
But I admit,
you make a great flapjack.

1259
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,442
Keep 'em coming.

1260
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:27,608
I'm gonna be late.

1261
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:29,275
See you all tonight.

1262
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:30,900
- Have fun.
- Say hi to Emma.

1263
01:22:30,983 --> 01:22:32,942
Oh la la.

1264
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,650
Mom, don't encourage them.

1265
01:22:39,233 --> 01:22:40,900
Don't encourage who?

1266
01:22:40,983 --> 01:22:44,025
Hi Emma... Perfect timing.

1267
01:22:44,108 --> 01:22:45,233
What are you watching?

1268
01:22:45,317 --> 01:22:47,192
When you uploaded your videos,

1269
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:49,233
you uploaded all your videos.

1270
01:22:49,317 --> 01:22:50,483
Uh-oh.

1271
01:22:50,567 --> 01:22:55,275
<i>Emma, it turns out, life is short.
I wish I would've told you how I felt...</i>

1272
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:56,817
Hey!

1273
01:22:58,692 --> 01:23:00,275
Will you go out with me?

1274
01:23:15,525 --> 01:23:18,525
Never mind them, let's get out of here.

1275
01:23:21,233 --> 01:23:22,983
Oh.

1276
01:23:28,275 --> 01:23:31,275
Our boy's all grown up.

1277
01:23:33,692 --> 01:23:35,817
Can I get another pancake over here?
